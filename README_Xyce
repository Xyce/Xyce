The L_UTSOI model contained in this directory has been modified from
the original.

-- Module attributes have been added to allow the device to plug into Xyce
   as the level 10240 MOSFET

-- An explicit "M" (multiplicity) parameter has been added and every
   contribution has explicitly been multiplied by this factor.  Xyce
   does not support an implicit m factor.

-- The OP_CALC macro definition was uncommented, enabling all output variables
   to be accessible for Xyce.
