Code in this directory creates an interface to Xyce as a persistent object.  
It is used to provide both a ctypes-based Python interface and a Verilog 
Procedural Interface (VPI) to Xyce.  See the "Application Note: Mixed Signal 
Simulation with Xyce" document by Peter Sholander and Rich Schiek for more 
details on:

  1) How to build Xyce as "shared objects" that can be linked with, or
invoked by, other simulators.

  2) How to set up your Python environment to use the ctypes-based Python
interface to Xyce.  This entails changes to your PYTHONPATH environment
variable.

  3) Working examples for both Python and VPI.

Additional examples are also found in the subdirectories Python_examples
and VPI_examples.  For Xyce 6.11, the interfaces and examples have only
been tested for a serial build of Xyce on RHEL6 and RHEL7.

The file UpdatePythonPath.sh is a simple "non-working" example of how to set
the PYTHONPATH environment variable with bash.  The directory path in that
files must be modified for your local machine, as noted in the Application
Note referenced above.  It can then be run as:

. ./UpdatePythonPath.sh

The python interface, with the file runACircuit.py, can then be invoked as
follows:

python runACircuit.py </path/to/where/libxycecinterface/is/installed>
