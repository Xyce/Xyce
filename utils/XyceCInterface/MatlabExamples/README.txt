This directory contains examples of calling Xyce from Matlab.

The Matlab examples use Xyce's Python interface from Matlab.  Thus,
one should ensure that they are using a version of Python compatible with
Matlab (see https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/python-compatibility.html).

Additionally, one should test the Python examples to ensure the Xyce - Python 
layer is installed and working correctly.  See the directory above this one 
labeled PythonExamples.

Finally the Matlab script in this directory will need to edited for the location
of your local installation of Xyce's share directory where the python file 
xyce_interface.py is located.

See the document Application Note: Using Xyce From Python, Matlab and Simulink for
more details.
