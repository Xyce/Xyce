The bsimcmg_body.include code in the code directory has been modified
from the original in the following ways:

  - All parameters that are noted in the BSIM-CMG technical note as being
    instance parameters have had the "type" attribute set to "instance"

  - Parameters that have been noted as both instance and model in the technical
    note have been had the "type" attribute set to "instance" and the Xyce-
    specific "xyceAlsoModel" attribute set to "YES"

  - Attributes have been added to the module statements so that Xyce can use
    the model as a MOSFET more easily with less hand-editing of the ADMS
    output.

  - In a number of cases, integer constants "0" were being passed as
    arguments to the min or max functions.  This is problematic in
    emitting C++, and resulted in compilation errors when a matching
    templatized function could not be found.  These integer "0" were
    replaced with "0.0".
