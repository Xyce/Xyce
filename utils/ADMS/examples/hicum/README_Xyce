The HICUM Level 2, version 2.4.0 Verilog-A source was obtained from 
https://www.iee.et.tu-dresden.de/iee/eb/hic_new/hic_intro.html

The following modifications to the original have been made:

- Xyce/ADMS cannot perform collapse of external nodes to ground.  The
  block of code in HICUM that does this has been commented out, and
  the alternate block of code provided by developers in case
  collapse-to-ground is not supported has been uncommented

- A single contribution that mixed static and dynamice (ddt) terms has
  been broken into two separate contributions, one wholly static, the
  other wholly dynamic.  Xyce/ADMS cannot handle mixed contributions
  of this sort.

- The "MODEL" block of code has been turned into an "INSTANCE" block.
  It contains variables that are used in the main block later to add
  dependence on the tnode probe, and as such those variables should
  belong to an instance, not the model.  This change means nothing
  unless one is using ADMS, as the "MODEL" macro is defined as empty
  except for ADMS.

- module attributes have been added to allow HICUM to plug in to Xyce as
  BJT level 234.
