The mvsg_cmc_1.1.0.va code in the "vacode" directory has been modified
from the original in the following ways:

 - Git's idea of "whitespace errors" (white space at end of line and end
   of file) has been cleaned up so git will not show these warnings.
 - A Unicode-encoded apostrophe in a copyright notice was changed to ASCII.

 - Prior to the implementation of ddx in Xyce/ADMS, the single use of ddx in
   the noise model rendered Xyce unable to implement
   that noise model.  The entire contents of the noise model have been ifdefed
   out and replaced with an error condition if noisemod is set to 1.  Though
   Xyce/ADMS now supports ddx(), the noise model has not been reenabled
   in our implementation.


 - A newly-discovered limitation in the handling of node collapse in Xyce/ADMS
   requires that the node collapse expression:
      V(si,src) <+ 0;
   be written instead as:
      V(src,si) <+ 0;
   This is necessary because both src and si are internal nodes, and Xyce/ADMS
   generally tries to collapse the negative node onto the positive in such
   cases.  Unfortunately, elsewhere in the device src may be collapsed onto
   the external node s, and therefore leads to an ambiguous collapse (does
   src collapse onto s or si?  Or both?).  Reversing the order makes it clear
   that si may collapse onto src, and src may then also collapse onto s ---
   resulting in the collapse of si onto s as well.

 - The assignments of rcs_w, rcd_w, and rg were moved from their original
   location in the main analog block into an @(initial_instance) (ADMS-specific
   pseudo-event block) so that they are promoted to "global_instance" scope.
   This is necessary to allow them to be used in Xyce for
   node collapse conditionals as intended by the model authors.

 - As originally written, the code inside the "gmdisp==0" else block
   combined both static and dynamic contributions on a single line.  ADMS
   and Xyce/ADMS will silently accept this usage and then generate incorrect
   code.  The dynamic contributions (those inside ddt() calls) must be
   added in a seperate contribution statement than the static contributions.
