The following changes were made to BSIM-CMG 108 for its import into
Xyce:


 - In bsimcmg_main.include, __OPINFO__ was undefined.  Xyce/ADMS does
   not yet support the ddx operator needed, nor does Xyce/ADMS yet
   permit operating point information to be output.

 - The "module" line was renamed to "bsimcmg_108" to deconflict the
   resulting C++ from other bsimcmg models in Xyce, because the module
   name is used for various class and namespace names.

 - The TNOIMOD=1 model, introduced in BSIM-CMG 108 and then removed in
   BSIM-CMG 110, has been ifdefed out.  It uses ddx, which is
   currently unsupported in Xyce/ADMS.  Since this noise model was
   removed by the BSIM group after only one release, it should probably
   not be getting used anyway.

 - Module attributes added to make this device import as the level 108
   MOSFET.

  - All parameters that are noted in the BSIM-CMG technical note as being
    instance parameters have had the "type" attribute set to "instance"

  - Parameters that have been noted as both instance and model in the technical
    note have been had the "type" attribute set to "instance" and the Xyce-
    specific "xyceAlsoModel" attribute set to "YES"

  - In a number of cases, integer constants "0" were being passed as
    arguments to the min or max functions.  This is problematic in
    emitting C++, and resulted in compilation errors when a matching
    templatized function could not be found.  These integer "0" were
    replaced with "0.0".

  - An ADMS specific "initial_instance" pseudo event was added around
    the bias-independent initialization block so that it is not
    unnecessarily recomputed along with the bias-dependent code.


  - When __TNOIMOD2__ is enabled, but TNOIMOD is not set to 2, it
    is necessary to collapse the internal N node to ground.  Failure
    to do this leads to convergence errors.  This was fixed in BSIM-CMG 110,
    and we are back-porting that fix to 108 in Xyce.
