The following changes to the BSIMCMG 111.2.1 code were needed to make
it work with Xyce/ADMS.

1.  Modify main bsimcmg function name (in the bsimcmg.va file) to include 
    level, and add attributes.  I'm following the convention of other BSIM CMG devices
    in Xyce.  

2.  Fix the `lexp macro to remove ADMS lexical error in the bsimcmg_macros.include file.
    This macro uses a ternary operator, and it seems that in order for ADMS
    to parse it properly, it needed more parenthesis.  I've encountered
    similar problems parsing ternaries in other contexts, so this probably
    isn't surprising.

3.  Add @initial_instance statement to a block of code near the beginning of bsimcmg_
    body.include file.  Also, a corresponding "begin" and "end" statement has been 
    added.  This was necessary as some of these variables are used in node collapse 
    conditionals.  Also, it makes the code more efficient to execute these lines 
    once, rather than at every function evaluation.

4.  Convert some of the params to be both instance and model.  At the top of the
    bsimcmg_parameters.include, there is a block of parameters identified to be
    both model and instance parameters.  In order for this to work in ADMS/Xyce,
    it is necessary to modify their attributes to include xyceAlsoModel="yes".
    This is done with new macros (added to the bsimcmg_macros.include file)
    that have the name suffix "_BOTH".
