The EKV model version 2.6 provided by its authors will not process
correctly in ADMS due to a number of minor problems.  As a result, the
version provided here has been modified slightly.


- The macro "NOT_GIVEN" has changed sign from -1e21 to 1e21.  That is
  because in several places where it was used it was used as
  "-`NOT_GIVEN", resulting in the preprocessor emitting "--1e-21", an
  illegal expression in ADMS.

- The white noise and flicker noise terms for the "ds" branch were
  summed together in a single contribution statement.  This usage,
  while perfectly legal Verilog-A, is incorrectly handled by the
  Xyce/ADMS system.  The two terms have been separated out into to
  separate contribution statements.

- The range for the TEMP parameter in the published version was oddly
  set to [273.15:inf], despite supposedly being a temperature in
  celsius.  Clearly, the intent was that it be [-273.15:inf]
  reflecting a range of absolute zero to infinity.  The TEMP parameter
  is later properly converted to Kelvin and stored in a T variable
  which is clearly intended to be in Kelvin.  So in this version we have
  changed the allowable range to [-273.15:inf].  Doing so prevents
  Xyce from throwing meaningless warnings about reasonable Celsius
  temperatures being out of range.

- Attributes have been added to the declarations of the parameters L,
  W, M, NS, AS, AD, PS, and PD so that they can be specified on the
  instance line of a Xyce netlist.  All of these may also be specified
  on the model card for compatibility with other simulators.

- Module attributes have been added to allow this model to plug into
  Xyce as the level 260 MOSFET ("M" device) with associated NMOS and
  PMOS model cards.
