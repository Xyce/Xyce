FOSS EKV2.6 Compact Model

The EKV2.6 MOSFET compact model has had a considerable impact on the
academic and industrial community of analog integrated circuit design,
since its inception in 1996. The model is available as a free
open-source software (FOSS) tool coded in Verilog-A. The present
depository provides a short review of foundations of the model and
shows its capabilities via characterization and modeling based on a
test chip in 180 nm CMOS fabricated via Europractice.
