In order to work in Xyce, several things in the BSIM SOI 4.6.1 code
needed modification.  These are documented here:


- Xyce/ADMS now supports the $port_connected function to specify
  optional nodes, but the BSIM-SOI 4.5.0 model uses it in a manner completely
  inconsistent with Xyce.  We have copied the optional node handling code from
  BSIM-SOI 4.6.1 (which was also modified to work with Xyce and emit fatal
  errors in some invalid use cases) into BSIM-SOI 4.5.0 instead.  This allows
  the 5-, 6-, and 7- node instances of BSIM-SOI to work, but only when the
  optional nodes are actually being loaded by the device (i.e., not when
  SOIMOD=2).

  These modified blocks of code are wrapped inside conditional compilation
  blocks checking the definition of "__XYCE__".  The blocks at issue here all
  contain further ifdefs checking "PORT_CONNECTED".

- Attributes have been added to some parameters to make them instance
  or both instance and model parameters.

- Bias-independent code has been wrapped in an ADMS-specific
  "@(initial_instance)" pseudo-event.  Doing so assures that this code
  is only executed when necessary --- at code initialization or
  whenever an instance or model parameter changes as part of a .STEP
  analysis.  As a consequence of this change, a line of code setting
  "DevTemp" to the ambient temperature needed to be duplicated both in
  the initial_instance and main body of the code.

- Explicit use of a multiplicity factor has been introduced.  Xyce
  does not have implicit multiplicity for devices, and requires that
  every device implement it explicitly.

- Several contributions contained both static and dynamic (ddt())
  terms, which ADMS and Xyce/ADMS mishandle.  These contributions were
  broken up into separate static-only and dynamic-only contributions.
