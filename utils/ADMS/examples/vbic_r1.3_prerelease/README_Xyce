The VBIC 1.3 model has been modified for inclusion in Xyce:

  - Module attributes have been added to make the VBIC 1.3 accessible as
    BJT model levels 11 (3-terminal) and 12 (4-terminal).

  - The dt node, normally an internal node of the VBIC 1.3, has been made  an
    external node to satisfy Sandia user requirements.

  - The external dt node has been made optional by post-ADMS patches.

  - Xyce-specific attributes have been added to all parameters

  - Since Xyce/ADMS supports some---but not all---of the features
    selected by the VAMS_COMPACT_MODELING ifdef in
    cmcGeneralMacrosAndDefines.va, this file has been modified to add
    an ifdef for "__XYCE_COMPACT_MODELING__" that selects the features
    of the former that Xyce/ADMS actually accepts, without sacrificing
    as much as turning off VAMS_COMPACT_MODELING would have done in
    the original.

  - pnjlim voltage limiting and junction voltage initialization have
    been applied to the base-emitter and base-collector junctions, as
    recommended in earlier VBIC documentation.

  - A simple $limit has been applied to the thermal node.  This uses
    an analog function defined in xyceSpecificAnalogFunctions.va.

  - @(initial_instance) and @(initial_model) have been added to the
    initializeInstance and initializeModel blocks, ifdef'd with an
    "`ifdef insideADMS".

  - One line of instance-variable-dependent initialization has been
    moved out of the initializeModel block and into the
    intializeInstance block.  It is illegal in Xyce/ADMS to reference
    instance parameters from the code in an @(initial_model) block,
    because models do not know what instance to use.

  - All variables that had been declared inside the top-level "analog
    block begin/end" block have been moved out of the block and into
    the module level.  This is to work around an ADMS limitation that
    renders it impossible to render variables used in
    @(initial_instance) or @(initial_model) and the main block as
    "global_instance" or "global_model" variables.  Declaring them
    inside the block makes them block-local, always.

  - An "OFF" parameter has been added that disables initialization of
    junction voltages for the first DCOP point.
