The HICUM Level 0, version 1.32 Verilog-A source was obtained from 
https://www.iee.et.tu-dresden.de/iee/eb/hic_new/hic_start.html

The following modifications to the original have been made:

- module attributes have been added to allow HICUM to plug in to Xyce as BJT
  level 230.

- Xyce/ADMS cannot perform collapse of external nodes to ground.  The block of
  code in HICUM that does this has been commented out, and the alternate block
  of code provided by developers in case collapse-to-ground is not supported
  has been uncommented

- The "INITIAL_MODEL" macro was added to the commented-out code that followed
  it, since the use of @(initial_model) throws an error otherwise; the code
  appears to be commented out due to a change in handling of the transistor
  type (NPN vs. PNP), so INITAL_MODEL should do nothing.

- While Xyce/ADMS does support operating point variables, it does not
  support port currents such as "I(<B>)" and in fact generates
  incorrect code when they are used.  Hicum attempts to use these
  things to provide three output variables for base, collector, and
  emitter currents.  These had to be ifdeffed out.  The same
  information can be obtained using the IC(instance), IB(instance),
  and IE(instance) accessors on a Xyce print line.
