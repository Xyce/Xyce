The Verilog-A examples in this directory are just here to show how
various simple devices can be implemented.

Some have had module attributes added so that they can be imported
into Xyce as extra model levels of existing device types, others
(e.g. the rlc examples) are left without module attributes to
demonstrate how these devices can be imported by default as Y devices.

The rlc.va example here is identical to the one in the user_plugin
directory.

The DiodeClipper.cir file in this directory may be used to test the 
diode2.va, vsrc.va, resistor.va, and capacitor.va models in this directory.

Build a plugin from these models using the instructions in the Xyce/ADMS
Users' Guide, and run Xyce with the plugin on DiodeClipper.cir.  You will
see signals similar to (but not identical to) those described in the 
Xyce Users' Guide.  The differences are due to the simplicity of the 
diode2.va model compared to the SPICE diode.
