/*
 *  MATRIX ELEMENT DATA STRUCTURE
 *
 *  Every nonzero element in the matrix is stored in a dynamically allocated
 *  MatrixElement structure.  These structures are linked together in an
 *  orthogonal linked list.  Two different MatrixElement structures exist.
 *  One is used when only real matrices are expected, it is missing an entry
 *  for imaginary data.  The other is used if complex matrices are expected.
 *  It contains an entry for imaginary data.
 *
 *  >>> Structure fields:
 *  Real  (RealNumber)
 *      The real portion of the value of the element.  Real must be the first
 *      field in this structure.
 *  Imag  (RealNumber)
 *      The imaginary portion of the value of the element. If the matrix
 *      routines are not compiled to handle complex matrices, then this
 *      field does not exist.  If it exists, it must follow immediately after
 *      Real.
 *  Row  (int)
 *      The row number of the element.
 *  Col  (int)
 *      The column number of the element.
 *  NextInRow  (struct MatrixElement *)
 *      NextInRow contains a pointer to the next element in the row to the
 *      right of this element.  If this element is the last nonzero in the
 *      row then NextInRow contains NULL.
 *  NextInCol  (struct MatrixElement *)
 *      NextInCol contains a pointer to the next element in the column below
 *      this element.  If this element is the last nonzero in the column then
 *      NextInCol contains NULL.
 *  pInitInfo  (char *)
 *      Pointer to user data used for initialization of the matrix element.
 *      Initialized to NULL.
 *
 *  >>> Type definitions:
 *  ElementPtr
 *      A pointer to a MatrixElement.
 *  ArrayOfElementPtrs
 *      An array of ElementPtrs.  Used for FirstInRow, FirstInCol and
 *      Diag pointer arrays.

/*
 *  MATRIX FRAME DATA STRUCTURE

 *      addressing).
 *  DoRealDirect  (BOOLEAN *)
 *      Array of flags, one for each column in matrix.  If a flag is true

 *      external row numbers.  Present only if TRANSLATE option is set true.
 *  Factored  (BOOLEAN)
 *      Indicates if matrix has been factored.  This flag is set true in
 *      spFactor() and spOrderAndFactor() and set false in spCreate()

 *      Array of pointers that point to the first nonzero element of the row
 *      corresponding to the index.
 *  ID  (unsigned long int)
 *      A constant that provides the sparse data structure with a signature.
 *      When DEBUG is true, all externally available sparse routines check
 *      this signature to assure they are operating on a valid matrix.
 *  Intermediate  (RealVector)
 *      Temporary storage used in the spSolve routines. Intermediate is an
 *      array used during forward and backward substitution.  It is
 *      commonly called y when the forward and backward substitution process is
 *      denoted  Ax = b => Ly = b and Ux = y.
 *  InternalVectorsAllocated  (BOOLEAN)

 *      external row numbers.
 *  MarkowitzCol  (int [])
 *      An array that contains the count of the non-zero elements excluding
 *      the pivots for each column. Used to generate and update MarkowitzProd.
 *  MarkowitzProd  (long [])
 *      The array of the products of the Markowitz row and column counts. The
 *      element with the smallest product is the best pivot to use to maintain
 *      sparsity.
 *  MarkowitzRow  (int [])
 *      An array that contains the count of the non-zero elements excluding
 *      the pivots for each row. Used to generate and update MarkowitzProd.
 *  MaxRowCountInLowerTri  (int)
 *      The maximum number of off-diagonal element in the rows of L, the
 *      lower triangular matrix.  This quantity is used when computing an
 *      estimate of the roundoff error in the matrix.
 *  Max_TS (double)
 *      The maximum time step since last pivot determination.
 *  NeedsOrdering  (BOOLEAN)
 *      This is a flag that signifies that the matrix needs to be ordered
 *      or reordered.  NeedsOrdering is set true in spCreate() and
 *      spGetElement() or spGetAdmittance() if new elements are added to the
 *      matrix after it has been previously factored.  It is set false in
 *      spOrderAndFactor().
 *  NumberOfInterchangesIsOdd  (BOOLEAN)
 *      Flag that indicates the sum of row and column interchange counts
 *      is an odd number.  Used when determining the sign of the determinant.
 *  Partitioned  (BOOLEAN)
 *      This flag indicates that the columns of the matrix have been 
 *      partitioned into two groups.  Those that will be addressed directly

 *      Column pivot was chosen from.
 *  PivotsOriginalRow  (int)
 *      Row pivot was chosen from.
 *  PivotSelectionMethod  (char)
 *      Character that indicates which pivot search method was successful.
 *  PreviousMatrixWasComplex  (BOOLEAN)
 *      This flag in needed to determine how to clear the matrix.  When
 *      dealing with real matrices, it is important that the imaginary terms
 *      in the matrix elements be zero.  Thus, if the previous matrix was
 *      complex, then the current matrix will be cleared as if it were complex
 *      even if it is real.
 *  RelThreshold  (RealNumber)
 *      The magnitude an element must have relative to others in its row
 *      to be considered as a pivot candidate, except as a last resort.
 *  Reordered  (BOOLEAN)
 *      This flag signifies that the matrix has been reordered.  It
 *      is cleared in spCreate(), set in spMNA_Preorder() and
 *      spOrderAndFactor() and is used in spPrint().
 *  RowsLinked  (BOOLEAN)
 *      A flag that indicates whether the row pointers exist.  The AddByIndex
 *      routines do not generate the row pointers, which are needed by some
 *      of the other routines, such as spOrderAndFactor() and spScale().
 *      The row pointers are generated in the function spcLinkRows().
 *  SingularCol  (int)
 *      Normally zero, but if matrix is found to be singular, SingularCol is
 *      assigned the external column number of pivot that was zero.
 *  SingularRow  (int)
 *      Normally zero, but if matrix is found to be singular, SingularRow is
 *      assigned the external row number of pivot that was zero.
 *  Singletons  (int)
 *      The number of singletons available for pivoting.  Note that if row I
 *      and column I both contain singletons, only one of them is counted.
 *  Size  (int)
 *      Number of rows and columns in the matrix.  Does not change as matrix
 *      is factored.
 *  TrashCan  (MatrixElement)
 *      This is a dummy MatrixElement that is used to by the user to stuff
 *      data related to the zero row or column.  In other words, when the user
 *      adds an element in row zero or column zero, then the matrix returns
 *      a pointer to TrashCan.  In this way the user can have a uniform way
 *      data into the matrix independent of whether a component is connected
 *      to ground.
 *
 *  >>> The remaining fields are related to memory allocation.
 *  TopOfAllocationList  (AllocationListPtr)
 *      Pointer which points to the top entry in a list. The list contains
 *      all the pointers to the segments of memory that have been allocated
 *      to this matrix. This is used when the memory is to be freed on
 *      deallocation of the matrix.
 *  RecordsRemaining  (int)
 *      Number of slots left in the list of allocations.
 *  NextAvailElement  (ElementPtr)
 *      Pointer to the next available element which has been allocated but as
 *      yet is unused. Matrix elements are allocated in groups of
 *      ELEMENTS_PER_ALLOCATION in order to speed element allocation and
 *      freeing.
 *  ElementsRemaining  (int)
 *      Number of unused elements left in last block of elements allocated.
 *  NextAvailFillin  (ElementPtr)
 *      Pointer to the next available fill-in which has been allocated but
 *      as yet is unused.  Fill-ins are allocated in a group in order to keep
 *      them physically close in memory to the rest of the matrix.
 *  FillinsRemaining  (int)
 *      Number of unused fill-ins left in the last block of fill-ins
 *      allocated.
 *  FirstFillinListNode  (FillinListNodeStruct *)
 *      A pointer to the head of the linked-list that keeps track of the
 *      lists of fill-ins.
 *  LastFillinListNode  (FillinListNodeStruct *)
 *      A pointer to the tail of the linked-list that keeps track of the
 *      lists of fill-ins.
