// Purpose        : Abstract interface for general "vector loading"
//                  callback classes.
//
//
// Special Notes  : This can be used to implement a generic call-back interface
//                  for external simulators.  The GeneralExternal device
//                  will use this to call back to the external simulator to
//                  get the DAE vector and matrix elements associated with
//                  the device.
