# Xyce Configure, Build and Installation Guide Using CMake

> [!NOTE]
> __The Autotools configuration and build system is DEPRECATED in Xyce 7.10__

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This guide describes the basic process for compiling and installing a Xyce
binary using the CMake build system. It is easiest to view these instructions
with full formatting on the [Xyce GitHub website](https://github.com/Xyce/Xyce/blob/master/INSTALL.md).
(For instructions on building Xyce with the deprecated Autotools system, see the
[Xyce Building Guide - DEPRECATED](https://xyce.sandia.gov/documentation-tutorials/building-guide/).)

Xyce can be built for serial execution or with distributed-memory (MPI) parallelism. This
is determined by the parallelism enabled in the build of Trilinos used to configure Xyce.  Multiple builds of Xyce can
co-exist on a system, but they must be installed in different directories (for both Trilinos and Xyce).

__Binary installers for Windows, Mac and Red Hat Linux are made available for the latest release of Xyce on the
[Xyce website](https://xyce.sandia.gov).__ Installers for previous versions of Xyce
may be made available upon request at the Xyce [contact-us](https://xyce.sandia.gov/contact-us/)
page.

## Overview

Building and installing Xyce from source requires the following general steps:
- Install the tools required in the list of [prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Build and install](#building-trilinos) Trilinos from [source code](https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos)
- [Download](https://xyce.sandia.gov/downloads/source-code) or [clone](https://github.com/Xyce/Xyce) the Xyce repository
- [Build and install](#building-xyce) Xyce

> [!NOTE] 
> Using install/uninstall commands may require administrative priviledges on Unix-like systems.

## Prerequisites

Xyce depends on many external libraries to supply enhanced parsing, mathematical 
algorithms and parallel communication. Some of the required libraries may already 
be present on your system, and many can be obtained with package managers. Rarely, 
some will have to be built from source. Install all of the required, and any of the
optional libraries related to capabilities of interest, prior to building Xyce.

| Name  | Version | Required | Notes |
| :---  | :---    | :---:    | :---  |
| CMake | 3.22 or later | No | [CMake](https://cmake.org) will the required in release 7.11. |
| Build system | various | Yes | CMake requires a build system; e.g., [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/), [Jom](https://wiki.qt.io/Jom) |
| C/C++ compiler | various | Yes | C++-17 compliant compiler; e.g., gcc 9 or later, Clang 5 or later |
| Fortran compiler | various | No | Trilinos has Fortran code, Xyce does not.  It is technically [optional](https://docs.trilinos.org/files/TrilinosBuildReference.html#disabling-the-fortran-compiler-and-all-fortran-code), but not using the Fortran code, though, could result in slower performance. | 
| MPI compiler | various | No | This is only required for a distributed-memory parallel build of Xyce. [Open MPI](http://www.open-mpi.org) ([MPICH](https://www.mpich.org/) should also work, but the Xyce team does not regularly build with that library). |
| bison | 3.3 or later | Yes | Included in most operating systems and package management systems. If not, [download](http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/), compile, and install the library. |
| flex | 2.6 or later | Yes | Included in most operating systems and package management systems. If not, [download]( https://github.com/westes/flex), compile, and install the library. |
| BLAS  | any | Yes | Most systems have a version of BLAS included with the compiler or in their package management systems.  If not, BLAS source code may be [downloaded](http://www.netlib.org/blas). |
| LAPACK | any | Yes | Most systems have a version of LAPACK included with the compiler or in their package management systems.  If not, LAPACK source code may be [downloaded](http://www.netlib.org/lapack). |
| FFT | FFTW 3.x or Intel MKL | No | This is required for Harmonic Balance analysis, which will be disabled without an FFT library.  FFTW3 is available in most package management systems. If not, download [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org) or the [Intel MKL](http://software.intel.com). |
| SuiteSparse | 7.8.3 or later | Yes | Xyce uses AMD through Trilinos, which is part of the SuiteSparse library.  If necessary, [download](https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse), [compile, and install](#building-suitesparse) the library.
| Trilinos | 14.4 and later | Yes | Xyce requires Trilinos for linear algebra and solvers.  The current minimum version of [Trilinos](https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos) usable in a cmake-configured Xyce is version 14.4.  __Versions after 14.4 have not been rigorously tested with Xyce and may not work properly.__ If necessary, [download](https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/archive/refs/heads/trilinos-release-14-4-branch.zip), [compile, and install](#building-trilinos) the library. |


The [Building Xyce](#building-xyce) 
section covers the traditional build method for Xyce.  Some operating systems require modifications to these instructions for Xyce or prerequisite libraries. Refer to the [System-Specific Modifications](#system-specific-modifications) section to review any notes or 
issues that have been documented for the operating system you are using.  There are also some general notes collected 
below to assist in building the prerequisite libraries.

<summary>Building SuiteSparse</summary>

### Building SuiteSparse
If SuiteSparse is not provided by a package manager, this is not difficult and more recent versions provide build 
support with CMake. SuiteSparse version 7.8.3 or later is recommended. Xyce only depends on the AMD and 
SuiteSparse_config packages in SuiteSparse.

```sh
cmake \
-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=</path/to/install/SuiteSparse> \
-D SUITESPARSE_ENABLE_PROJECTS="suitesparse_config;amd" \
-S <path/to/source-directory>\ 
-B <path/to/build-directory>\

cmake --build <> -j 2 -t install
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Building Trilinos</summary>

### Building Trilinos
Trilinos is an extensive set of numerical packages for a wide range of computational problems. This section will provide a general overview of building Trilinos for Xyce. For detailed questions on Trilinos or its build system see the Trilinos [getting started page](https://trilinos.github.io/getting_started.html).

>[!NOTE]
>[Trilinos](https://trilinos.github.io/) is available in some package
managers, but the particular installation may not have all the features required by Xyce. If Trilinos is available, you can try to use it to configure and build Xyce.  If any issue is encountered, build Trilinos using these instructions.

>[!NOTE]
> To build Trilinos on Windows, see the Windows section under
[System-Specific Modifications](#system-specific-modifications).

The following process will produce a serial Trilinos installation that will 
contain only the libraries needed by Xyce. For a distributed-memory parallel build, be sure to
understand the serial build process prior to reading the [Building Trilinos
with MPI Parallelism](#building-trilinos-with-mpi-parallelism) section.

Because of the size and complexity of Trilinos, it is recommended to build the necessary packages outside the Trilinos source code directories. 
1. Create a directory in a convenient location where you will build a serial version of Trilinos. 
2. Identify a convenient location for the Trilinos installation. On Unix-like systems, the default Trilinos installation
location is `/usr/local`. Multiple installations of Trilinos can exist on the same system, but they must be in different directories. We recommend specifying
unique sub-directories in `/usr/local`, such as `/usr/local/trilinos_serial`.  The installation directory can be changed by adding the following flag to the CMake invocation.
```sh
-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path/to/where-you-will-install-Trilinos> \
```
3. Verify the location of your compilers.  If you have compilers or libraries in non-standard locations, see the [Other
Trilinos Options](#other-trilinos-options) section, below.

A CMake "initial cache" file, called `trilinos-base.cmake`, is included in
the Xyce repository in the `cmake/trilinos` directory. The file contains a
typical set of options for a Xyce-oriented serial Trilinos build.

To configure Trilinos (using the default `/usr/local` install location), enter
the build directory and run:
```sh
cmake -C <path/to/Xyce>/cmake/trilinos/trilinos-base.cmake <path/to/Trilinos>
```
Once the configuration step has completed, run the following in the build
directory to build and install Trilinos:
```sh
cmake --build . -j 2 -t install
```
The "-j 2" designates the number of processors to be used for compiling
Trilinos. Choose an appropriate number for your system.

#### Other Trilinos Options

The following are various flags that might be needed when building Trilinos.
These can be added to the command line, or put in a [configuration
script](#configuration-scripts).

CMake will use the first compiler set it finds on your system. You can specify
the compilers by adding the following flags to the CMake invocation:
```sh
-D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=<C-compiler> \
-D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<C++-compiler> \
-D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=<Fortran-compiler> \
```
You may need to use a full path if they cannot be located in your default paths.

If no Fortran compiler is available you can use:
```
-DTrilinos_ENABLE_Fortran=OFF \
```
to disable any Fortran-dependent code in Trilinos.

On some systems it may be necessary to add the following to your CMake
invocation if the installed C compiler treats implicitly defined functions
as errors, such as Apple's clang.
```
-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration" \
```

Finally, if the third-party libraries (AMD, BLAS and LAPACK) cannot be located
in your default paths, use the following flags to help CMake find the
libraries:
```sh
-D AMD_LIBRARY_DIRS=/path/to/AMD/lib \
-D AMD_INCLUDE_DIRS=/path/to/AMD/include \
-D BLAS_LIBRARY_DIRS=/path/to/BLAS/lib \
-D LAPACK_LIBRARY_DIRS=/path/to/LAPACK/lib \
```
See the [Trilinos Build
Reference](https://docs.trilinos.org/files/TrilinosBuildReference.html) for
more details on the Trilinos build options.

#### Building Trilinos with MPI Parallelism

To enable MPI parallelism in Xyce, Trilinos must be built with MPI enabled. An
"initial cache" file, called `trilinos-MPI-base.cmake`, is provided for MPI
builds. In addition to using the MPI-oriented cache file, the MPI compilers
must be explicitly specified to CMake. The following CMake invocation should
work on most systems:
```sh
cmake \
-C <path/to/Xyce>/cmake/trilinos/trilinos-MPI-base.cmake \
-D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc \
-D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx \
-D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=mpifort \
<path/to/Trilinos>
```
Note that the exact compiler names may be different on your system. Also, the
above invocation will install Trilinos in `/usr/local`.

As with the serial build, once the configuration step is done, run the
following in the build directory to compile and install Trilinos:
```sh
cmake --build . -j 2 -t install
```
</details>

## Building Xyce

A generalized process for a serial build of Xyce, given that Trilinos is already [installed](#building-trilinos), can be summarized as:

```sh
cd <your-build-directory>
mkdir xyce-build
cd xyce-build

cmake \
-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path/to/where-you-will-install-Xyce> \
-D Trilinos_ROOT=</path/to/Trilinos-install-location> \
<path/to/Xyce>
```

The simple CMake invocation above assumes that:
- All the required [prerequisites](#prerequisites) are found in your default paths  
- Trilinos is installed in the `Trilinos_ROOT` directory
- Xyce will be installed in the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` directory
- The first compiler found in your default paths is the __same__ one used to build Trilinos.  

If a different C/C++ compiler was used to build Trilinos, specify that compiler using these commands:
```sh
-D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=<C-compiler> \
-D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<C++-compiler> \
```
You may need to use a full path if they cannot be located in your default paths.

>[!NOTE] __If you plan to have multiple builds of Xyce on your
system, they must be in different directories. We recommend specifying unique
sub-directories in `/usr/local`, such as `/usr/local/xyce_serial`.__

If a required prerequiste is not found in your default path, like flex or bison, then you can specify the location of those executables with these commands:
```sh
-D FLEX_EXECUTABLE=<path/to/flex-install-location>/bin/flex \
-D FLEX_INCLUDE_DIR=<path/to/flex-install-location>/include \
-D BISON_EXECUTABLE=<path/to/bison-install-location>/bin/bison \
```

Once the configuration step is done, run the
following in the `xyce-build` directory to compile and install Xyce in the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` directory:
```sh
cmake --build . -j 2 -t install
```
The "-j 2" designates the number of processors to be used for compiling Xyce.
Choose an appropriate number for your system.

### Building Xyce with MPI Parallelism

A generalized process for a parallel build of Xyce, given that Trilinos is already [installed](#building-trilinos), can be summarized as:

```sh
cd <your-build-directory>
mkdir xyce-mpi-build
cd xyce-mpi-build

cmake \
-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path/to/where-you-will-install-mpi-Xyce> \
-D Trilinos_ROOT=</path/to/Trilinos-mpi-install-location> \
-D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=<mpi-C-compiler> \
-D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<mpi-C++-compiler> \
<path/to/Xyce>
```

The simple CMake invocation above assumes that:
- All the required [prerequisites](#prerequisites) are found in your default paths  
- Trilinos is installed in the `Trilinos_ROOT` directory
- Xyce will be installed in the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` directory
- The MPI compilers provided to `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` and `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`  is the __same__ one used to build Trilinos.  

You may need to use a full path to the MPI compilers if they cannot be located in your default paths.  Also, if a required prerequiste is not found in your default path, like flex or bison, then you can specify the location of those executables (see above).  

As with the serial build, 
once the configuration step is done, run the
following in the `xyce-build` directory to compile and install Xyce in the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` directory:
```sh
cmake --build . -j 2 -t install
```  

### Adding the Xyce/ADMS Verilog-A Model Compiler

Xyce has a Verilog-A model compiler capability, which uses the "Xyce/ADMS"
compiler tool. See the [Xyce/ADMS Users
Guide](https://xyce.sandia.gov/documentation-tutorials/xyce-adms-users-guide/)
for more information on the capability and for instructions on using Xyce/ADMS.

To enable the feature with CMake, install [ADMS](https://github.com/Qucs/ADMS)
prior to building Xyce. Then, to enable the capability in the Xyce build, add
the following flag to the Xyce CMake invocation:
```sh
-D Xyce_PLUGIN_SUPPORT=ON
```
The CMake support for the plugin capability is still being developed. As such,
there are some differences from the website:
- The "toys" example is installed in `/path/to/install/share/examples/toys`.
- The `buildxyceplugin.sh` script requires the absolute path to the `.va`
  files.
- The name of the plugin file can vary by system (e.g., on a Mac, the "toys"
  library will be called, "libtoys.dylib", not "toys.so").

## Uninstalling Xyce

The Xyce CMake does not create an uninstall script. However, on installation it
does produce an "install manifest" file, which lists every installed file with
their full path. To remove a Xyce installation from a Unix-like system, simply
run:
```sh
xargs rm < install_manifest.txt
```
Note that the above method is immediate and permanent. You may also want to
uninstall Trilinos. As with Xyce, an `install_manifest.txt` file is produced
when Trilinos is installed.

If you do not want to keep the build directories, simply copy the
`install_manifest.txt` file(s) to a safe location (the file name can be
changed). Then Xyce and/or Trilinos can be uninstalled at any time using the
`xarg` command, above (be sure to specify the correct filename).

## Running the Test Suite

If you wish to test the Xyce installation, run the [Xyce Regression
Suite](https://github.com/Xyce/Xyce_Regression). See the [Running the Xyce Regression
Suite](https://xyce.sandia.gov/documentation-tutorials/running-the-xyce-regression-suite/)
documentation on the Xyce home page. Note that the test suite is controlled
with Perl and Bash scripts, and some tests require Python with Scipy and Numpy.

## Configuration Scripts

If many flags are being applied as part of a CMake invocation, you might want
to create a configuration script. This is essentially a shell script with the
CMake invocation. The following commands are for Unix-like systems. Analogous
scripts can be created for Windows systems.

As an example, to configure an MPI-enabled Trilinos build, one might create a
file containing:
```sh
#!/bin/sh

cmake \
-C path/to/Xyce/cmake/trilinos/trilinos-MPI-base.cmake \
-D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc \
-D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx \
-D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=mpifort \
-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/install/Trilinos/mpi/ \
path/to/Trilinos
```
More options can be added as needed. The file can be made executable by running
the following on the command line:
```sh
chmod a+x <filename>
```
Running the configuration script in the build directory is the same as running
the CMake configure line directly.

## System-Specific Modifications

The instructions above are applicable to most operating systems. However some operating systems require modifications to the above process, which are included here.

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>


*Build tools:*  
Compiling Xyce on Windows is not a small task at the moment, primarily because
Windows does not have the equivalent of a package manager. Internally, we use
the Intel compiler suite with the Intel [Math Kernel
Library](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/onemkl.html)
(MKL). The MKL provides the BLAS, LAPACK and FFT capabilities (removing the need
for FFTW). At the beginning of 2021, Intel rebranded their tool chains as the
[oneAPI](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi.html)
Toolkits, and makes them available for free. The [oneAPI Base
Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/base-toolkit.html)
is sufficient for building Xyce and Trilinos. Running the setvars.bat 
(Component Directory Layout) or oneapi-vars.bat (Unified Directory Layout) 
script that installs with oneAPI can help ensure that the necessary environment 
variables and paths are set for building.

Note that the oneAPI toolkit requires a compatible version of
[Microsoft C++ BuildTools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
to be installed first to provide required system libraries. Check the 
[Intel compiler compatibility site](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/reference-implementation/intel-compilers-compatibility-with-microsoft-visual-studio-and-xcode.html).
To find a suitable version of BuildTools, you may need to refer to one of the 
Long Term Servicing Channels for Visual Studio [2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-history#release-dates-and-build-numbers) or [2019](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/history).
The Microsoft Build Tools will also supply CMake, as well as several supported 
build tool options (msbuild, nmake and ninja).

Trilinos does not test their code on Windows (versions 14.0 and earlier may be 
unstable on Windows platforms). The initial configuration file for Trilinos in 
`path/to/Xyce/cmake/trilinos/trilinos-base.cmake` may require a few extra 
options:
```
cmake ^
    -C path\to\Xyce\cmake\trilinos\trilinos-base.cmake ^
    -D HAVE_TEUCHOS_LAPACKLARND=OFF ^
    -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Stokhos=OFF ^
    -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Sacado=OFF ^
    -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Amesos2=OFF ^
    ...
    path\to\Trilinos
```

On Windows, Bison and flex are available via the
[WinFlexBison](https://github.com/lexxmark/winflexbison) package. For
SuiteSparse, see the [Building SuiteSparse](#building-suitesparse) section
above, under [Obtaining the TPLs](#obtaining-the-tpls). Once all the TPLs are
in place, continue with the standard Trilinos and Xyce build processes.

To compile Xyce on Windows, there are additional CMake options that must be 
added in generating the build configuration.
```sh
-D Xyce_USE_FFT=TRUE
-D Xyce_USE_INTEL_FFT=TRUE
```

The Xyce CMake build system also supports a package target. On Windows, this 
target will generate a standalone installer for Xyce. The package target uses
[NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page) (version 3.0 or newer) to generate 
the installer. This is an additional third-party dependency that needs to be 
installed prior to building the package target.

```sh
cmake --build <path to build folder> -t package
```
-- or --
```sh
cpack <path to build folder>
```

*Test environment:*  
The Xyce regression suite is intended to run in a Unix-like environment. The 
engine that runs the regression suite consists primarily of bash, perl, and (to 
a lesser degree) python scripts.

While there is no native support for running the regression suite on Windows, 
there are various Unix compatibility tools that enable running the test suite in
a Windows environment. The Xyce team uses Cygwin to run Xyce regression testing 
on Windows. Other configurations that leverage utilites such as WSL, Minigw, 
or MSYS2 may also be possible, but are untested.

Cygwin installs a minimal set of packages by default, so all of the dependencies 
will have to be explicitly added. To run the full regression suite, the 
recommended set of packages include:
- liblapack-devel
- libopenblas
- gcc-fortran
- gcc-g++
- perl
- perl-libwww-perl
- bash
- python39
- python39-numpy
- python39-devel
- python39-pip
- diff
- cmake

There are few tests in the regression suite that use the python package scipy. 
This package is not included in any of the available cygwin packages. After 
cygwin is in place, you can use pip to install scipy.

<details>
<summary>Ubuntu</summary>

Ubuntu releases starting with 17.10 and through the 19.x series (including 18.04), have a broken version of Open MPI in their package repositories. __Open MPI is functional in Ubuntu 20.04.__
- In the problem releases, the version of Open MPI in the repositories is compiled with the `--enable-heterogeneous`
option, which breaks MPI's standard compliance and causes Xyce to fail in some situations.
- If you are running a version of Ubuntu that has this issue, the only workaround is to uninstall the Open MPI package and build Open MPI from source, without the `--enable-heterogeneous` option. Comment 11 of the [Launchpad bug
report](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openmpi/+bug/1731938/comments/11)
contains instructions for how to rebuild and install Open MPI using the Debian
package building system.

To check whether your system's install of Open MPI has this issue,
you can run a small test program from the Xyce source tree. To test your
Open MPI package, copy the file,
[Xyce/src/test/MPITest/testBUG967.c](src/test/MPITest/testBUG967.c), into
temporary directory. Then compile and run it using the following commands:
```sh
mpicc -o testBUG967 testBUG967.c
mpirun -np 2 ./testBUG967
```
If the run produces any output with the word __BAD__, your Open MPI install is broken and cannot be used. You must instead use the workaround described above.
</details>

<details>
<summary>MacOS</summary>

MacOS provides a code development environment through [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), which includes a C/C++ compiler and BLAS/LAPACK libraries.

MacOS does not have a native package manager, but there are several third-party package managers available. The Xyce team has had success with [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

- Rarely failures have been observed when using the Apple Clang compilers _and not_
using a Fortran compiler. If the Trilinos build fails while compiling AztecOO,
then you will either need to use different C/C++ compilers, or install gfortran
with a package manager (it is usually supplied with the gcc package).

__Xyce/ADMS on MacOS__\
The `buildxyceplugin.sh` script relies on the behavior of GNU "readlink", which is very different than BSD readlink (MacOS is based on BSD Unix). You can obtain GNU readlink by installing the "coreutils" package from MacPorts or Homebrew.
