OUTPUTS      & Comma separated list of outputs (anything that would be a valid \texttt{.PRINT} output variable) & -- \\ \hline
COVMATRIX    & Covariance matrix specified in row major form as comma-separated double precision numbers. & -- \\ \hline
SAMPLE\_TYPE & Sampling type (MC or LHS). This is only used if resampling is enabled. & MC \\ \hline
SEED         & Random seed. This is only used if resampling is enabled. & See footnote.\footnotemark[1] \\ \hline
OUTPUT\_SAMPLE\_STATS   &  Compute and outputs statistics for specified outputs. & -- \\ \hline
RESAMPLE    & Once the PCE coefficients are obtained, perform sampling on the PCE approximation & -- \\ \hline
OUTPUT\_PCE\_COEFFS    & Output the PCE coefficients & -- \\ \hline
SPARSE\_GRID    &  Use sparse grid methods if using projection PCE.    & -- \\ \hline
STDOUTPUT    &  Send sampling and PCE output to the terminal   & -- \\ \hline

\footnotetext[1]{The seed can also be set using command line option, -randseed.   The command line seed will override the netlist seed value.  If the seed is not set in either the netlist or on the command line, then Xyce generates a seed internally.  In all cases, \Xyce{} will output text to the console indicating what seed is being used.}
