\index{\texttt{.RESULT}}
Outputs the value of user-specified expressions at the end of a simulation.

\begin{Command}

\format
\begin{alltt}
.RESULT \{output variable\}
\end{alltt}

\examples
\begin{alltt}
.RESULT \{V(a)\}
.RESULT \{V(a)+V(b)\}
\end{alltt}

\comments
The \texttt{.RESULT} line must use an expression.  The line \texttt{.RESULT V(a)} will result in a parse
error.

Each \texttt{.RESULT} line must have only one expression.  Multiple \texttt{.RESULT} lines can be
used though to output multiple columns in the output \texttt{.res} file.

\Xyce{} will not produce output for \texttt{.RESULT} statements if there are 
no \texttt{.STEP} statements in the netlist.   

\end{Command}

\subsubsection{Example Netlist}
\texttt{.RESULT} lines can be combined with \texttt{.STEP} lines to output the ending values of
multiple simulation runs in one \texttt{.res} file, as shown in the following usage example. The 
resultant \texttt{.res} file will have four lines that give the final values of the expressions
\texttt{\{v(b)\}} and \texttt{\{v(b)*v(b)/2\}} at time=0.75 seconds for all four requested 
combinations of \texttt{R2} and \texttt{v\_amplitude}. 
\begin{alltt}
Simple Example of .RESULT capability with .STEP
R1 a b 10.0
R2 b 0 2.0

.GLOBAL_PARAM  v_amplitude=2.0
Va a 0 sin (5.0 \{v_amplitude\} 1.0 0.0 0.0)

.PRINT TRAN v(b) \{v(b)*v(b)/2\}
.TRAN 0 0.75

.STEP R2 1.0 2.0 1.0 
.STEP v_amplitude 1.0 2.0 1.0

.RESULT \{v(b)\} 
.RESULT \{v(b)*v(b)/2\}

.END
\end{alltt}
