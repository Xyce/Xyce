\index{\texttt{.HB}}
\index{analysis!HB} \index{harmonic balance analysis}
Calculates steady states of nonlinear circuits in the frequency domain.

\begin{Command}

\format
.HB <fundamental frequencies>

\examples
.HB 1e4

.hb 1e4 2e2
\arguments

\begin{Arguments}
\argument{fundamental frequencies}
Sets the fundamental frequencies for the analysis.

\end{Arguments}

\comments

Harmonic balance analysis calculates the magnitude and phase of voltages
and currents in a nonlinear circuit. Use a \texttt{.OPTIONS HBINT}
statement to set additional harmonic balance analysis options.

The \texttt{.PRINT HB}\index{\texttt{.PRINT}}\index{results!print}\index{\texttt{.PRINT}!\texttt{HB}}
statement must be used to get the results of the harmonic balance analysis. 
See section \ref{.PRINT}.

Some devices that may be expected to work in HB analysis do not at
this time.  This includes, but is not limited to, the nonlinear
dependent sources (B source and nonlinear versions of E, F, G, and H
sources).
