\begin{abstract}

This document is a reference guide to the \Xyce{} Parallel Electronic
Simulator, and is a companion document to the \Xyce{} Users' Guide\UsersGuide.
The focus of this document is (to the extent
possible) exhaustively list device parameters, solver options, parser
options, and other usage details of \Xyce{}.  This document is \emph{not}
intended to be a tutorial.  Users who are new to circuit simulation are 
better served by the \Xyce{} Users' Guide\UsersGuide.
