The generic switch is similar to the voltage- or current-controlled
switch except that the control variable is anything that can be writen
as an expression.  The examples show how a voltage- or
current-controlled switch can be implemented with the generic switch.
Also shown is a relay that turns on when a certain time is reached.
Model parameters are given in Table ~\ref{S_1_Device_Model_Params}.

The voltage- and current-controlled switch syntaxes are converted at
parse time to their equivalent generic device, and so all three
variants in fact use the same code internally.

Hysteresis in the switching behavior of the device can be controlled with 
the model parameters \texttt{IHON}, \texttt{IHOFF}, \texttt{VHON} and
\texttt{IVOFF} for current and voltage controlled switches respectively.  
For a general switch that is dependent on an expression hysteresis can 
behavior can be set with the model parameters v\texttt{ONH} and \texttt{OFFH}. 
If none of these parameters are set then hysteresis is will not be used 
for the device. 

The power dissipated in the generic switch is calculated with $I \cdot \Delta V$ 
where the voltage drop is calculated as $(V_+ - V_-)$ and positive current 
flows from $V_+$ to $V_-$.  This will essentially be the power dissipated
in either \texttt{RON} or \texttt{ROFF}, since the generic switch is a particular 
type of controlled resistor.
