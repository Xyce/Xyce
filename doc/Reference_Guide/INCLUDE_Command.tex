Include specified file in netlist.

The file name can be surrounded by single or double quotes, 'filename'
or "filename", but this is not necessary.  The directory for the
include file is assumed to be the execution directory unless a full or
relative path is given as a part of the file name.

\begin{Command}
\format
\begin{alltt}
.INC <include file name>
.INCLUDE <include file name>
.INCL <include file name>
\end{alltt}

\examples
\begin{alltt}
.INC models.lib
.INC 'models.lib'
.INC "models.lib"
.INCLUDE models.lib
.INCLUDE 'models.lib'
.INCLUDE "path\_to\_library/models.lib"
\end{alltt}

\comments
If {\texttt <include file name>} uses an absolute path then that path
is used.  Otherwise, the search-path order for {\texttt <include file name>} is:
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Relative to the directory that contains {\texttt <include file name>}.
  \item Relative to the directory that contains the file with the top-level
netlist.
  \item Relative to the \Xyce{} execution directory.
\end{XyceItemize}

\end{Command}
