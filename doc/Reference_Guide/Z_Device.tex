\parameters

\begin{Parameters}

\param{drain node}
Node connected to drain.

\param{gate node}
Node connected to gate.

\param{source node}
Node connected to source.

\param{source node}
Name of model defined in .MODEL line.

\param{area value}

The \texttt{MESFET} is modeled as an intrinsic FET using an ohmic
resistance (\texttt{RD/area}) in series with the drain and another ohmic
resistance (\texttt{RS/area}) in series with the source.  \texttt{area value}
is a scaling factor with a default of 1.

\param{device parameters}

Parameters listed in Table~\ref{Z_1_Device_Instance_Params} may be
provided as space separated \texttt{<parameter>=<value>} specifications
as needed.  Any number of parameters may be specified.

\end{Parameters}

\comments

Although MESFETs can be made of Si, such devices are not as common as
GaAs MESFETS.  And since the mobility of electrons is much higher than
holes in GaAs, nearly all commercial devices are n-type MESFETS.

\paragraph{MESFET Power Calculations}
Power dissipated in the transistor is calculated with $I_{D}*V_{DS}+I_{G}*V_{GS}$ where
$I_{D}$ is the drain current, $I_{G}$ is the gate current, $V_{DS}$ is the 
voltage drop between the drain and the source and $V_{GS}$ is the voltage drop 
between the gate and the source. This formula may differ from other simulators,
such as HSPICE and PSpice.
