\parameters

\begin{Parameters}

\param{\vbox{\hbox{L\hfil}\hbox{M\hfil}}}

The MOSFET channel length and width that are decreased to get the actual
channel length and width. They may be given in the device
\texttt{.MODEL} or \texttt{.OPTIONS} statements. The value in the device
statement overrides the value in the model statement, which overrides
the value in the \texttt{.OPTIONS} statement. If \texttt{L} or \texttt{W}
values are not given, their default value is 100~$\mu$m.

\param{\vbox{\hbox{AD\hfil}\hbox{AS\hfil}}}

The drain and source diffusion areas. Defaults for \texttt{AD} and
\texttt{AS} can be set in the \texttt{.OPTIONS} statement.  If
\texttt{AD} or \texttt{AS} defaults are not set, their default value is
0.

\param{\vbox{\hbox{PD\hfil}\hbox{PS\hfil}}}
The drain and source diffusion perimeters. Their default value is 0.

\param{\vbox{\hbox{NRD\hfil}\hbox{NRS\hfil}}}

Multipliers (in units of $\Box$) that can be multiplied by \texttt{RSH}
to yield the parasitic (ohmic) resistances of the drain (\texttt{RD})
and source (\texttt{RS}), respectively.  \texttt{NRD}, \texttt{NRS}
default to 0.

Consider a square sheet of resistive material. Analysis shows that the
resistance between two parallel edges of such a sheet depends upon its
composition and thickness, but is independent of its size as long as it is
square. In other words, the resistance will be the same whether the square's
edge is 2~mm, 2~cm, or 2~m. For this reason, the \emph{sheet resistance} of
such a layer, abbreviated \texttt{RSH}, has units of Ohms per square,
written $\mathsf{\Omega}/\Box$.

\param{M}

If specified, the value is used as a number of parallel MOSFETs to be
simulated.  For example, if \texttt{M=2} is specified, \Xyce{} simulates two
identical mosfets connected to the same nodes in parallel.

\param{IC}

The BSIM3 (model level 9), BSIM4 (model level 14 or 54) and BSIMSOI (model
level 10) allow one to specify the initial voltage difference across
nodes of the device during the DC operating point calculation.  For the
BSIM3 and BSIM4 the syntax is \texttt{IC=$V_{ds}, V_{gs}, V_{bs}$}
where $V_{ds}$ is the voltage difference between the drain and source,
$V_{gs}$ is the voltage difference between the gate and source and
$V_{bs}$ is the voltage difference between the body and source.  The
BSIMSOI device's initial condition syntax is \texttt{IC=$V_{ds},
  V_{gs}, V_{bs}, V_{es}, V_{ps}$} where the two extra terms are the
voltage difference between the substrate and source, and the external
body and source nodes respectively.  Note that for any of these lists of
voltage differences, fewer than the full number of options may be
specified.  For example, \texttt{IC=5.0} specifies an initial condition on $V_{ds}$
but does not specifiy any initial conditions on the other nodes.
Therefore, one cannot specify $V_{gs}$ without specifying $V_{ds}$, etc.

It is illegal to specify initial conditions on any nodes that are tied
together.  \Xyce{} attempts to catch such errors, but complex circuits may
stymie this error trap.

\end{Parameters}

\vbox{\hrulefill}
\item[BSIM-SOI Options]

There are a large number of extra instance parameters and optional
nodes available for the BSIM-SOI (level 10 (BSIM-SOI 3.2), level 70
(BSIM-SOI 4.6.1), and level 70450 (BSIM-SOI 4.5.0)) MOSFET.  Please
consult the BSIM-SOI technical manual, available at
\url{http://bsim.berkeley.edu/models/bsimsoi/}, for full details.

\begin{Parameters}

\param{substrate node}

The fourth node of the BSIM-SOI device is always the substrate node,
which is referred to as the \texttt{E} node. 

\param{external body contact node}

If given, the fifth node is the external body contact node,
\texttt{P}.  It is connected to the internal body node through a body
tie resistor.  If \texttt{P} is not given, the internal body node is
not accessible from the netlist and floats.

{\em For the BSIM-SOI 3.2 (level=10) only):} If there are only five
nodes specified and \texttt{TNODEOUT} is also specified, the fifth
node is the temperature node instead.

\param{internal body contact node}

If given, the sixth node is the internal body contact node, \texttt{B}.  It is
connected to the external body node through a body tie resistor.  If \texttt{B}
is not given and \texttt{P} is given, the internal body node is not accessible
from the netlist, but is still tied to the external body contact through the
tie resistance.

{\em For the BSIM-SOI 3.2 (level=10) only):} If there are only six
nodes specified and \texttt{TNODEOUT} is also specified, the sixth
node is the temperature node instead.

\param{temperature node}

{\em For the BSIM-SOI 3.2 (level=10) only):} If the parameter \texttt{TNODEOUT} is specified, the final node (fifth, sixth,
or seventh) is interpreted as a temperature node.  The temperature node is
intended for thermal coupling simulation.

{\em For the BSIM-SOI 4.x (level=70 or 70450) only):} The temperature
node is only accessible for thermal coupling if it is the seventh
node.  It is available for printing as an internal node in all other
configurations.

\param{BJTOFF}
Turns off the parasitic BJT currents.

\param{IC}
The \texttt{IC} parameter allows specification of the five junction initial
conditions, $V_{ds}, V_{gs}, V_{bs}, V_{es}$ and $V_{ps}$.  $V_{ps}$ is ignored
in a four-terminal device.

\param{RTH0}
Thermal resistance per unit width.  Taken from model card if not given.

\param{CTH0}
Thermal capacitance per unit width.  Taken from model card if not given.

\param{NBC}
Number of body contact isolation edges.

\param{NSEG}
Number of segments for channel width partitioning.

\param{PDBCP}
Parasitic perimeter length for body contact at drain side.

\param{PSBCP}
Parasitic perimeter length for body contact at source side.

\param{AGBCP}
Parasitic gate-to-body overlap area for body contact.

\param{AEBCP}
Parasitic body-to-substrate overlap area for body contact.

\param{VBSUSR}
Optional initial value of VBS specified by user for use in transient
analysis.  (unused in \Xyce{}).

\param{FRBODY}
Layout-dependent body resistance coefficient.

\end{Parameters}

\comments

The simulator provides multiple MOSFET device models, which differ in the
formulation of the I-V characteristic. The \texttt{LEVEL} parameter
selects among different models as shown below.

For HSPICE compatibility, the BSIM4 model can be specified with either
level 14 or level 54.

If a model supports parameter aliases (e.g. ``U0'' and ``UO'' or
``VT0'' and ``VTO'' in the levels 1-6 MOSFETS), it would be a mistake
to specify both parameters and give them different values.  There is
no warning or error message if you do that.  Don't do that.

\end{Device}

\paragraph{MOSFET Operating Temperature}
Model parameters may be assigned unique measurement temperatures using the
\textrmb{TNOM} model parameter. See the MOSFET model parameters for more
information.

\paragraph{MOSFET Power Calculations}
Power dissipated in the transistor is calculated with $I_{D}*V_{DS}+I_{G}*V_{GS}$ where
$I_{D}$ is the drain current, $I_{G}$ is the gate current, $V_{DS}$ is the
voltage drop between the drain and the source and $V_{GS}$ is the voltage drop
between the gate and the source. This formula may differ from other simulators,
such as HSPICE and PSpice.

\paragraph{Internal Device Variables Accessible with {\tt N()} Syntax}
For the BSIM3, BSIM4, and BSIM-CMG version 110 models, several
internal variables have been made accessible with the {\tt N()} syntax
on a {\tt .PRINT} line.  They are $g_{m}$ (tranconductance), $V_{th}$,
$V_{ds}$, $V_{gs}$, $V_{bs}$, and $V_{dsat}$.  An example {\tt .PRINT}
line command for a MOSFET device named {\tt m1} would be:
\begin{alltt}
.print dc N(m1:gm) N(m1:Vth) N(m1:Vdsat) N(m1:Vds) N(m1:Vgs) N(m1:Vbs)
\end{alltt}
The BSIM-CMG also supports output of $I_{ds}$ (drain-source current)
in this manner.

If the user runs \texttt{Xyce -namesfile <filename> <netlist>} then
\Xyce{} will output into the first filename a list of all solution
variables generated by that netlist. This can be useful for
determining the ``fully-qualified'' device name, needed for the {\tt
  N()} syntax, if the device is in a subcircuit.

\paragraph{Instance Parameters}
Tables ~\ref{M_1_Device_Instance_Params}, ~\ref{M_2_Device_Instance_Params}, 
~\ref{M_3_Device_Instance_Params},  ~\ref{M_6_Device_Instance_Params},
\ref{M_9_Device_Instance_Params} and \ref{M_10_Device_Instance_Params}  
give the available instance parameters for the levels 1,2,3,6,9 and 10 MOSFETs,
respectively.

In addition to the parameters shown in the tables, where a list of
numbered initial condition parameters are shown, the MOSFETs support a vector
parameter for the initial conditions.  \texttt{IC1} and \texttt{IC2}
may therefore be specified compactly as \texttt{IC=<ic1>,<ic2>}.

\paragraph{Model Parameters}
Tables ~\ref{M_1_Device_Model_Params}, ~\ref{M_2_Device_Model_Params},
~\ref{M_3_Device_Model_Params}, ~\ref{M_6_Device_Model_Params},
~\ref{M_9_Device_Model_Params}, and ~\ref{M_10_Device_Model_Params}
give the available model parameters for the levels 1,2,3,6,9 and 10 MOSFETs,
respectively.

For a thorough description of MOSFET models see~\cite{Antognetti:1988, HLJHCKH,
BLETK:1997, SH:1968, VL:1980,
SSKJ:1987, Pierret:1984, YEC:1983, BSIM3:V3:1, BN}.

\subparagraph{All MOSFET models}
The parameters shared by all MOSFET model levels are principally parasitic
element values (e.g., series resistance, overlap capacitance, etc.).

\subparagraph{Model levels 1 and 3}
The DC behaviors of the level 1 and 3 MOSFET models are defined by the
parameters \textrmb{VTO}, \textrmb{KP}, \textrmb{LAMBDA}, \textrmb{PHI}, and
\textrmb{GAMMA}.  The simulator calculates these if the process parameters
(e.g., \textrmb{TOX}, and \textrmb{NSUB}) are specified, but these are always
overridden by any user-defined values. The \textrmb{VTO} value is positive
(negative) for modeling the enhancement mode and negative (positive) for the
depletion mode of N-channel (P-channel) devices.

For MOSFETs, the capacitance model enforces charge conservation,
influencing just the Level 1 and 3 models.

Effective device parameter lengths and widths are calculated as follows:
\[
P_i = P_0 + P_L / L_e + P_W / W_e
\]
where
\[
\begin{array}{rclcl}
L_e & = & \mbox{effective length} & = & \mathbf{L} - (2 \cdot \mathbf{LD}) \\
W_e & = & \mbox{effective width} & = & \mathbf{W} - (2 \cdot \mathbf{WD})
\end{array}
\]

See \textrmb{.MODEL} (model definition) for more information.

\subparagraph{Model level 9 (BSIM3 version 3.2.2)}
The University of California, Berkeley BSIM3 model is a physical-based model
with a large number of dependencies on essential dimensional and processing
parameters.  It incorporates the key effects that are critical in modeling
deep-submicrometer MOSFETs.  These include threshold voltage reduction,
nonuniform doping, mobility reduction due to the vertical field, bulk charge
effect, carrier velocity saturation, drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL),
channel length modulation (CLM), hot-carrier-induced output resistance
reduction, subthreshold conduction, source/drain parasitic resistance,
substrate current induced body effect (SCBE) and drain voltage reduction in LDD
structure.

The BSIM3 Version 3.2.2 model is a deep submicron MOSFET model with several major
enhancements over earlier versions.  These include a single I-V formula used
to define the current and output conductance for operating regions, improved
narrow width device modeling, a superior capacitance model with improved short
and narrow geometry models, a new relaxation-time model to better transient
modeling and enhanced model fitting of assorted W/L ratios using a single
parameter set.  This version preserves the large number of integrated
dependencies on dimensional and processing parameters of the Version 2 model.
For further information, see Reference~\cite{HLJHCKH}.

\subparagraph{Additional notes}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If any of the following BSIM3 3.2.2 model parameters are not specified,
they are computed via the following:

If \textrmb{VTHO} is not specified, then:
\[
\mathbf{VTHO} = \mathbf{VFB} + \phi_s \mathbf{K1} \sqrt{\phi_s}
\]
where:
\[
\mathbf{VFB} = -1.0
\]
If \textrmb{VTHO} is given, then:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbf{VFB} & = & \mathbf{VTHO} - \phi_s + \mathbf{K1}\sqrt{phi_s} \\
\mathbf{VBX} & = & \phi_s - \frac{q\cdot\mathbf{NCH} \cdot
\mathbf{XT}^2}{2\varepsilon_{si}} \\
\mathbf{CF} & = & \left( \frac{2\varepsilon_{ox}}{\pi} \right)
\ln \left(1 + \frac{1}{4 \times 10^7\cdot\mathbf{TOX}} \right)
\end{eqnarray*}
where:
\[
E_g(T) = \mbox{the energy bandgap at temperature }T = 1.16 - \frac{T^2}{7.02
\times 10^4(T + 1108)}
\]

\item If \textrmb{K1} and \textrmb{K2} are not given then they are computed via
the following:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathbf{K1} &=& \mathbf{GAMMA2} - 2 \cdot \mathbf{K2} \sqrt{\phi_s -
\mathbf{VBM}} \\
\mathbf{K2} &=& \frac{(\mathbf{GAMMA1} -
\mathbf{GAMMA2})(\sqrt{\phi_s - \mathbf{VBX}} -
\sqrt{\phi_s})}{2\sqrt{\phi_s}(\sqrt{\phi_s - \mathbf{VBM}} -
\sqrt{\phi_s}) + \mathbf{VBM}}
\end{eqnarray*}
where:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\phi_s & = & 2V_t \ln \left(\frac{\mathbf{NCH}}{n_i} \right) \\
V_t    & = & kT / q \\
n_i    & = & 1.45 \times 10^{10} \left(\frac{T}{300.15}
\right)^{1.5} \exp \left(21.5565981 - \frac{E_g(T)}{2V_t} \right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\item If \textrmb{NCH} is not specified and \textrmb{GAMMA1} is, then:
\[
\mathbf{NCH} = \frac{\mathbf{GAMMA1^2 \times \mathbf{COX}^2}}
{2q \varepsilon_{si}}
\]
If \textrmb{GAMMA1} and \textrmb{NCH} {\em are not} specified, then
\textrmb{NCH} defaults to $1.7\times10^{23}\;m^{-3}$ and \textrmb{GAMMA1} is
computed using \textrmb{NCH}:
\[
\mathbf{GAMMA1} = \frac{\sqrt{2q\varepsilon_{si} \cdot \mathbf{NCH}}}
{\mathbf{COX}}
\]
If \textrmb{GAMMA2} is not specified, then:
\[
\mathbf{GAMMA2} = \frac{\sqrt{2q\varepsilon_{si} \cdot \mathbf{NSUB}}}
{\mathbf{COX}}
\]

\item If \textrmb{CGSO} is not specified and $\mathbf{DLC} > 0$, then:
\[
\mathbf{CGSO} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
0, & ((\mathbf{DLC \cdot COX) - CGSL)} < 0        \\
0.6 \cdot \mathbf{XJ \cdot COX}, & ((\mathbf{DLC \cdot COX) - CGSL)}
\geq 0
\end{array}
\right.
\]

\item If \textrmb{CGDO} is not specified and $\mathbf{DLC} > 0$, then:
\[
\mathbf{CGDO} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
0, & ((\mathbf{DLC \cdot COX) - CGSL)} < 0 \\
0.6 \cdot \mathbf{XJ \cdot COX},
& ((\mathbf{DLC \cdot COX) - CGSL)} \geq 0
\end{array}
\right. \]
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Model level 10 (BSIM-SOI version 3.2)}

The BSIM-SOI is an international standard model for SOI (silicon on insulator)
circuit design and is formulated on top of the BSIM3v3 framework.
A detailed description can be found in the BSIM-SOI 3.1 User's
Manual~\cite{BSIMSOI:Manual} and the BSIM-SOI 3.2 release
notes~\cite{BSIMSOI:3p2:Notes}.

This version (v3.2) of the BSIM-SOI includes three depletion models;
the partially depleted BSIM-SOI PD (soiMod=0), the fully depleted BSIM-SOI
FD (soiMod=2), and the unified SOI model (soiMod=1).

BSIMPD is the
Partial-Depletion (PD) mode of the BSIM-SOI.  A typical PD SOI MOSFET is formed
on a thin SOI film which is layered on top of a buried oxide.  BSIMPD has
the following features and enhancements:
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Real floating body simulation of both I-V and C-V.  The body potential is
      determined by the balance of all body current components.
\item An improved parasitic bipolar current model.  This includes enhancements in
      the various diode leakage components, second order effects (high-level
      injection and Early effect), diffusion charge equation, and temperature
      dependence of the diode junction capacitance.
\item An improved impact-ionization current model.  The contribution from BJT
      current is also modeled by the parameter Fbjtii.
\item A gate-to-body tunneling current model, which is important to thin-oxide
      SOI technologies.
\item Enhancements in the threshold voltage and bulk charge formulation of the
      high positive body bias regime.
\item Instance parameters (Pdbcp, Psbcp, Agbcp, Aebcp, Nbc) are provided to model
      the parasitics of devices with various body-contact and isolation structures.
\item An external body node (the 6th node) and other improvements are introduced
      to facilitate the modeling of distributed body resistance.
\item Self heating.  An external temperature node (the 7th node) is supported to
      facilitate the simulation of thermal coupling among neighboring devices.
\item A unique SOI low frequency noise model, including a new excess noise resulting
      from the floating body effect.
\item Width dependence of the body effect is modeled by parameters (K1,K1w1,K1w2).
\item Improved history dependence of the body charges with two new parameters
      (Fbody, DLCB).
\item An instance parameter Vbsusr is provided for users to set the transient initial
      condition of the body potential.
\item The new charge-thickness capacitance model introduced in BSIM3v3.2,
      \texttt{capMod=3}, is included.
\end{XyceItemize}

\paragraph{Quadratic Temperature Compensation}
SPICE temperature effects are the default, but MOSFET levels 18, 19 and 20 have
a more advanced temperature compensation available.  By specifying
\texttt{TEMPMODEL=QUADRATIC} in the netlist, parameters can be interpolated
quadratically between measured values extracted from data.  See
Section~\ref{Model_Interpolation} for more details.

\paragraph{MOSFET Equations}
The following equations define an N-channel MOSFET. The P-channel
devices use a reverse the sign for all voltages and currents.  The
equations use the following variables:
\begin{eqnarray*}
V_{bs}  &=&\mbox{intrinsic substrate-intrinsic source voltage} \\
V_{bd}  &=&\mbox{intrinsic substrate-intrinsic drain voltage} \\
V_{ds}  &=&\mbox{intrinsic drain-substrate source voltage} \\
V_{dsat}&=&\mbox{saturation voltage} \\
V_{gs}  &=&\mbox{intrinsic gate-intrinsic source voltage} \\
V_{gd}  &=&\mbox{intrinsic gate-intrinsic drain voltage} \\
V_t     &=&kT / q \mbox{ (thermal voltage)} \\
V_{th}  &=&\mbox{threshold voltage} \\
C_{ox}  &=&\mbox{the gate oxide capacitance per unit area} \\
f       &=&\mbox{noise frequency} \\
k       &=&\mbox{Boltzmann's constant} \\
q       &=&\mbox{electron charge} \\
Leff    &=&\mbox{effective channel length} \\
Weff    &=&\mbox{effective channel width} \\
T       &=&\mbox{analysis temperature (K)} \\
T_0     &=&\mbox{nominal temperature (set using TNOM option)}
\end{eqnarray*}
Other variables are listed in the BJT Equations section~\ref{bjt_equations}.

\subsubsection{Level 14/54 MOSFET Tables (BSIM4)}
The level 14 MOSFET device in \Xyce{} is based on the Berkeley BSIM4 model
version 4.6.1.  (For HSPICE compatibility, the Xyce BSIM4 model can also be
specified as level 54.)  The model's parameters are given in the following
tables.  Note that the parameters have not all been properly categorized with
units in place.  For complete documentation of the BSIM4 model, see the BSIM4
Userâ€™s Manual, available for download at
\url{http://bsim.berkeley.edu/models/bsim4/}.

Note that the BSIM4 device in Xyce now supports multiple versions
selectable with the \texttt{VERSION} parameter in the model card.  At
this time versions 4.6.1, 4.7.0, and 4.8.2 are supported.  This
version parameter may be specified either in legacy text format
(``4.6.1'' or ``4.8.2'') or in the CMC standard floating point format
(``4.61'' or ``4.82'').

If a \texttt{VERSION} parameter is not given, the latest version
supported is used.

If a \texttt{VERSION} parameter is given that is not one of the
supported version numbers, the closest matching supported version is
used instead and a warning given.  If a version older than the lowest
supported version is chosen, the lowest supported version (4.6.1) is
used and a warning given.  If a model lower than version 4.7.0 is
requested, version 4.6.1 is used (and a warning given).  If a version
newer than 4.7.0 but older than 4.8.0 is requested, 4.7.0 is used and
a warning given.  If a version 4.8.0 or later is requested, 4.8.2 is
used with an appropriate warning.

Specifying any model parameter that is
not supported in the chosen version results in a warning and the
parameter being ignored.  Parameters that are only valid for specific
ranges of versions are noted as such in the
tables~\ref{M_14_Device_Instance_Params} and
\ref{M_14_Device_Model_Params}.

At this time, the BSIM4 is the only device in Xyce that supports
multiple versions in this manner.  All other devices that have
multiple version in Xyce are handled by having a unique level number
for each version.

\textbf{NOTE: Many BSIM4 parameters listed in
  tables~\ref{M_14_Device_Instance_Params} and
  \ref{M_14_Device_Model_Params} as having default values of zero are
  actually replaced with internally computed defaults if not given.
  Specifying zero in your model card will override this internal
  computation.  It is recommended that you only set model parameters
  that you are actually changing from defaults and that you not
  generate model cards containing default values from the tables.
}

\textbf{
  Furthermore, the value of \texttt{FGIDL} changed from 0 to 1 with
  version 4.8.2 of the BSIM4.  This change is NOT reflected in the
  table, which is generated automatically, and which shows only the
  default value of this parameter that applies to versions 4.6.1 and
  4.7.0.}

\subsubsection{Level 18 MOSFET Tables (VDMOS)}
The vertical double-diffused power MOSFET model is based on the uniform charge
control model (UCCM) developed at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute~\cite{Fjeldly:1998}.
The VDMOS current-voltage characteristics are described by a single, continuous
analytical expression for all regimes of operation.  The physics-based model
includes effects such as velocity saturation in the channel, drain induced barrier
lowering, finite output conductance in saturation, the quasi-saturation effect
through a bias dependent drain parasitic resistance, effects of bulk charge, and
bias dependent low-field mobility.  An important feature of the implementation
is the utilization of a single continuous expression for the drain current, which
is valid below and above threshold, effectively removing discontinuities and
improving convergence properties.

The following tables give parameters for the level 18 MOSFET.

\subsubsection{Levels 70 and 70450 MOSFET Tables (BSIM-SOI 4.6.1 and 4.5.0)}
For complete documentation of the BSIM-SOI model, see the users'
manual for the BSIM-SOI, available for download at
\url{http://bsim.berkeley.edu/models/bsimsoi/}.  \Xyce{} implements
Version 4.6.1 of the BSIM-SOI as the level 70 device and version 4.5.0
as level 70450.

Instance and model parameters of the level 70 MOSFET are given in
tables~\ref{M_70_Device_Instance_Params} and
\ref{M_70_Device_Model_Params}.

Beginning with \Xyce{} 7.2, the BSIM-SOI models level 70 and 70450
have {\em limited} support for the optional 5th, 6th, and 7th nodes.
See the BSIM-SOI technical manual at the BSIM web site for details of
what configurations the full device supports.  Only some of these use
cases are supported: Use of the BSIM-SOI 4.x with \texttt{TNODEOUT=0}
(the default) is supported in 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-node configurations.
\texttt{TNODEOUT=1} is supported only in the 7-node configuration,
with the 7th node being temperature.  No access to the external
temperature node is available in 5- or 6- node configuration.

When \texttt{TNODEOUT=0}, the temperature node is an internal node of
the device even when not specified on the instance line, and its value
may still be printed using the N() notation (see
section~\ref{Print_Device_Info}).  This somewhat minimizes the impact
of the lack of support for \texttt{TNODEOUT=1} in \Xyce{} --- the
temperature rise due to self-heating is always available for printing,
but it is not available for creation of a thermal coupling network
except in the 7-node configuration.

Note that with some choices of model parameters, the BSIM-SOI devices
attempt to ``collapse'' the ``P'' and ``B'' nodes (external and
internal body nodes, 5th and 6th netlist nodes if given, internal
nodes if not given).  Xyce is unable to perform such collapse when the
nodes are externally specified, and will issue warnings when it finds
the model trying to do so.  Depending on the actual nodes used for P
and B, the device may fail to converge or produce invalid results; as
an example, if P and B are actually specified on the netlist line to
be the same node, this failure to collapse will not matter --- the
nodes are already the same.  But if two different node names are used
for the 5th and 6th nodes, the failure to collapse will leave one node
floating and the simulation will likely fail if the printed warnings
are ignored.

A similar problem exists for other choices of model parameter: in some
cases neither the ``P'' nor ``B'' nodes are used, and if the nodes are
specified on the netlist line the BSIM-SOI code attempts to collapse
them to ground.  This is not something \Xyce{} can do, and therefore
instead \Xyce{} ignores the specified nodes.  This can leave those
nodes floating and lead to convergence failures unless the specified
nodes are already the ground node (node 0).  \Xyce{} will issue
appropriate warnings when this condition exists and suggest removal of
the unused external nodes from the instance line.

The BSIM SOI 4.6.1 device supports output of the internal variables in
table~\ref{M_70_OutputVars} on the \texttt{.PRINT} line of a netlist.
To access them from a print line, use the syntax
\texttt{N(<instance>:<variable>)} where ``\texttt{<instance>}'' refers to the
name of the specific level 70 M device in your netlist.

\textbf{NOTE:} It has been observed that the gate capacitance model of
BSIM-SOI 4.6.1 behaves differently than earlier versions, and the team
has seen significant disagreement of gate currents when comparing
identical simulations with other simulators that have only earlier
BSIM-SOI models.  For this reason, we are also providing BSIM-SOI
4.5.0 as the level 70450 MOSFET.  This model does agree with these
other simulators.  The parameters and output variables are given in
tables~\ref{M_70450_Device_Instance_Params},
\ref{M_70450_Device_Model_Params}, and \ref{M_70450_OutputVars}.
Unlike BSIM-SOI 4.6.1, the 4.5.0 model's original Verilog-A source
code does not contain descriptions and units for the parameters, and
these appear blank in the tables.  For descriptions and units, see the
corresponding parameters in the level 70 tables.

\subsubsection{Level 77 MOSFET Tables (BSIM6 version 6.1.1)}
\Xyce{} includes the BSIM6 MOSFET model, version 6.1.1.  Full
documentation of the BSIM6 is available at its web site,
\url{http://bsim.berkeley.edu/models/bsim6/}.  Instance and model
parameters for the BSIM6 are given in
tables~\ref{M_77_Device_Instance_Params} and
\ref{M_77_Device_Model_Params}.  These tables are generated directly
from information present in the original Verilog-A implementation of
the BSIM6, and lack many descriptions for the parameters.  Consult the
BSIM6 technical manual from the BSIM group for further details about
these parameters.

Beginning with version 7.2 of \Xyce{}, an optional fifth node may be
specified for BSIM6 devices.  If specified, it is the temperature
node, which is used by the self-heating model and is internal if not
specified on the instance line.

The BSIM6 device supports output of the internal variables in
table~\ref{M_77_OutputVars} on the \texttt{.PRINT} line of a netlist.
To access them from a print line, use the syntax
\texttt{N(<instance>:<variable>)} where ``\texttt{<instance>}'' refers to the
name of the specific level 77 M device in your netlist.

are not backward compatible with the older 102 versions, and some
foundries provide model cards that use the version 102.  Development
of new model cards should be done using the more recent, supported
versions of PSP.

\Xyce{} includes the PSP MOSFET model, version 103.4~\cite{PSP:2006}.
The version without self-heating is the level 103 MOSFET, and the
version with self-heating is the level 1031.  Note that the level 1031
MOSFET requires five nodes on its instance line: drain, gate, source,
bulk, and dt.  The fifth node will be the temperature rise of the
device due to self-heating.

Full documentation for the PSP model is available on its web site,

\subsubsection{Level 260 MOSFET Tables (EKV version 2.6)}

MOSFET device.

Official documentation of this model may be found at \url{https://www.epfl.ch/labs/iclab/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ekv_v262.pdf}.

We have implemented EKV 2.6 directly from the Verilog-A source
published by its authors at \url{https://github.com/ekv26/model}.
While it is a faithful implementation of the model provided there, we
have had anecdotal evidence that other simulators have different
implementations that contain additional parameters and possibly a
different extrinsic model.  Model cards containing parameters
extracted from other simulators may not result in \Xyce{} simulations
that match those other simulators.  Watch carefully for any warnings
from \Xyce{} regarding unrecognized model parameters, as these are a
strong indication that the model card is not extracted using the exact
version of EKV provided by \Xyce{}.

Tables of EKV MOSFET 2.6 parameters are in
tables~\ref{M_260_Device_Instance_Params} and
\ref{M_260_Device_Model_Params}.

Note that in the tables the device claims that the default
\texttt{TNOM} and \texttt{TEMP} parameter values is 1e21.  This is
merely an artifact of an unusual way the authors have defined those
parameters in the Verilog-A source.  In fact, if not given
\texttt{TNOM} defaults to 25 $^\circ$ C, and if not given \texttt{TEMP}
defaults to the ambient temperature of the simulation.
