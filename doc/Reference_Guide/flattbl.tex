%% ERK: Note:  I made each row of the table actually be two rows, because the 
%% graphical cross section picture, which is coming from a jpg file, was 
%% tending to overwrite the lines of the table.  In particular, it was 
%% overwriting the line immediately above it.  It did this for every 
%% (length, width) value that I tried.
