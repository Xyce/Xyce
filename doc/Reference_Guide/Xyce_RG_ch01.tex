\chapteroverview{Welcome to \XyceTitle{}}
{
The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support, in a
rigorous manner, the simulation needs of the Sandia National Laboratories
\index{Sandia National Laboratories} electrical designers.  It is targeted 
specifically to run on large-scale parallel computing
\index{parallel!computing} platforms but also runs well on a variety
of architectures including single processor workstations.  It also aims to
support a variety of devices and models specific to Sandia needs.

\section{Overview}
\label{Overview}

This document is intended to complement the \Xyce{} Users' 
Guide\UsersGuide.  It contains comprehensive, detailed
information about a number of topics pertinent to the usage of \Xyce{}.  
Included in this document is a
netlist reference for the input-file commands and elements supported 
within \Xyce{}; a command line reference, which describes the 
available command line arguments for \Xyce{}; and quick-references for 
users of other circuit codes, such as Orcad's PSpice~\cite{PSpiceUG:1998}.

\section{How to Use this Guide}
\label{HowTo_Guide}

This guide is designed so you can quickly find the information you need to 
use \Xyce{}.  It assumes that you are familiar with basic Unix-type 
commands, how \index{Unix}Unix manages applications and files to 
perform routine tasks (e.g., starting applications, opening files and 
saving your work).  Note that while Windows versions of \Xyce{} are 
available, they are command-line programs meant to be run under the 
\emph{Command Prompt}, and are used almost identically to their Unix counterparts.

\section{Typographical conventions}
Before continuing in this Reference Guide, it is important to understand 
the terms and typographical conventions used.  Procedures for performing 
an operation are generally indicated with the following typographical 
conventions.
