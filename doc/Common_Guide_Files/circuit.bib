A physics-based approach is used to model displacement damage effects, and this modeling approach is implemented as an augmentation to the Gummel-Poon BJT model. The model is presented and implemented in the Xyce circuit simulator, and is shown to agree well with experiments and TCAD simulation, and is shown to be superior to a previous compact modeling approach.},

abstract = {Circuit simulation codes, such as SPICE, are invaluable in the development and design of electronic circuits in radiation environments. These codes are often employed to study the effect of many thousands of devices under transient current conditions. Device-scale simulation codes are commonly used in the design of individual semiconductor components, but computational requirements limit their use to small-scale circuits. Analytic solutions to the ambipolar diffusion equation, an approximation to the carrier transport equations, may be used to characterize the transient currents at nodes within a circuit simulator. We present new analytic transient excess carrier density and photocurrent solutions to the ambipolar diffusion equation for 1-D abrupt-junction pn diodes. These solutions incorporate low-level radiation pulses and take into account a finite device geometry, ohmic fields outside the depleted region, and an arbitrary change in the carrier lifetime due to neutron irradiation or other effects. The solutions are specifically evaluated for the case of an abrupt change in the carrier lifetime during or after, a step, square, or piecewise linear radiation pulse. Noting slow convergence of the Fourier series solutions for some parameters sets, we evaluate portions of the solutions using closed-form formulas, which result in a two order of magnitude increase in computational efficiency.},

title = {Transient Annealing in Semiconductor Devices Following Pulsed Neutron Irradiation},
abstract = {Transient annealing following pulsed neutron exposure has been investigated in silicon transistors and solar cells as a function of both irradiation temperature and injection level. In addition, experiments incorporating both X and gamma ray irradiation have demonstrated that transient annealing is a bulk, not a surface, effect. The observed annealing following neutron irradiation is considerably slower at low temperatures than at room temperature. At 213$\,^{\circ}$K thg density of annealable defects remaining at 10-10 seconds after exposure is approximately three times that observed at this same time for a 300$\,^{\circ}$K irradiation. The injection studies show that at any temperatures from 76$\,^{\circ}$K to 300$\,^{\circ}$K the presence of minority carrier injection considerably speeds the transient annealing processes. A model is presented which explains many of the features observed in transient annealing. Various kinetic processes are discussed in the derivation of this model, including diffusion-limited and generation-limited processes, and the results of the model are compared with experimental data.

The code uses a stabilized, finite-element discretization of the semiconductor drift-diffusion equations. The mathematical model used to simulate semiconductor devices in both normal and radiation environments  will be described. Modeling of defect complexes is accomplished by adding an additional drift-diffusion equation for each of the defect species. Additionally, details are  given describing how Charon can efficiently solve very large problems using modern  parallel computers. Comparison between Charon and experiment will be given, as well as comparison with results from commercially-available TCAD codes. },
