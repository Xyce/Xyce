\section{Introduction}
\label{analysis_intro}

\Xyce{} supports several simulation analysis options, including DC
bias point (\texttt{.DC}, section~\ref{DC_Analysis}), transient
(\texttt{.TRAN}, section~\ref{Transient_Analysis}), AC (\texttt{.AC},
section~\ref{AC_Analysis}), Noise (\texttt{.NOISE},
section~\ref{NOISE_Analysis}), harmonic balance (\texttt{.HB}, section
~\ref{HB_Analysis}), and sensitivity (\texttt{.SENS},
section~\ref{SENS_Analysis}) analysis.
%, and multitime partial differential equation (PDE) (\texttt{.MPDE}, section~\ref{MPDE_Analysis}) analysis. 

Using \texttt{.STEP}(section~\ref{STEP_Analysis}), \Xyce{} can also
apply an outer parametric loop to any type of analysis. This allows
one (for example) to sweep a model parameter and perform a transient
simulation for each parameter value.

Using \texttt{.SAMPLING}(section~\ref{SAMPLING_Analysis}), \Xyce{} can
apply random sampling loop to any type of analysis.  This will compute
statistical moments for various circuit outputs.

There are some analysis types typically found in SPICE-style
simulators that are still a work in progress for \Xyce{}. Operating
point analysis (\texttt{.OP}, section ~\ref{OP_Analysis}) is partially
supported in \Xyce{}.

\section{Steady-State (.DC) Analysis}
\label{DC_Analysis}
\label{DC_Sweep_Overview}
\index{analysis!DC} \index{DC analysis}
\index{DC Sweep} \index{analysis!DC sweep}

The DC sweep analysis capability in \Xyce{} computes the DC bias point
of a circuit for a range of values of input sources.  DC sweep is
supported for a source or device parameter, through a range of
specified values.  As the sweep proceeds, \Xyce{} computes the bias
point\index{bias point} for each value in the specified range of the
sweep.

If the variable to be swept is a voltage or current source, a DC
source must be used and its value set in the netlist (see \Xyce{}
Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{}). In simulating the DC response of an
analog circuit, \Xyce{} eliminates time dependence from the circuit by
treating capacitor elements as open circuits and inductor elements as
short circuits, while using only the DC values of voltage and current
sources.

\subsection{.DC Statement}

To specify a \verb|.DC| analysis, include a \verb|.DC| line in the netlist.  Some examples of typical \verb|.DC| lines are:

\Example{\\
\texttt{ .DC V1  7m 5m -1m } \\
\texttt{ .DC I1  5u 10u 1u } \\
\texttt{ .DC M1:L  7u 5u -1u } \\
\texttt{ .DC OCT V0 0.125 64 2 } \\
\texttt{ .DC DEC R1 100 10000 3 } \\
\texttt{ .DC TEMP LIST 10.0 15.0 18.0 27.0 33.0 }\\
\texttt{ .DC data=table }
}

The examples include several types of sweep --- linear, octave,
decade, list and data.  They also demonstrate sweeping over voltage
and current sources as well as device parameters.  The \Xyce{}
Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{} provides a complete description of
each.

\subsection{Setting Up and Running a DC Sweep}
\label{Running_DC_Sweep}
\index{DC sweep!running}

Following the example given in section~\ref{DC_Sweep},
figure~\ref{Clipper_Netlist3} shows the diode clipper circuit netlist
with a DC sweep analysis specified.  Here, the voltage source
\texttt{Vin} is swept from -10 to 15 in 1-volt increments, resulting
in 26 DC operating point calculations.

NOTE: \Xyce{} ignores the default setting for \texttt{Vin} during
these calculations.  All other source values use the specified values
(in this case, \texttt{VCC = 5V}).

Running \Xyce{} on this netlist produces an output results file named
\verb|clipper.cir.prn|.  Obtaining this file requires specifying the
\verb|.PRINT DC| line. Plotting this data produces the graph shown in
figure~\ref{Clipper_DCSweep2}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{OP Analysis}
\label{OP_Analysis}
\index{\texttt{.OP}}
\index{DC sweep!OP Analysis}
\index{OP analysis}

\Xyce{} also supports \texttt{.OP} analysis statements.  In \Xyce{},
consider \texttt{.OP} as a shorthand for a single-step DC sweep, in
which all the default operating point values are used.  One may also
consider \texttt{.OP} analysis to be the operating point calculation
that would occur as the initial step to a transient calculation,
without the subsequent time steps.

This capability was mainly added to enable the code to handle legacy
netlists using this analysis statement type.  In most versions of
SPICE, using \texttt{.OP} results in extra output not available from a
DC sweep.  \Xyce{} will also output some of this extra information about
devices, but the capability is not fully implemented.

\subsection{Output}
\label{DC_Output}\index{\texttt{.PRINT}!\texttt{DC}}

During analysis a number of output files may be generated.  The
selection of which files are created depends on a variety of factors,
most obvious of which is the \texttt{.PRINT} command.
Table~\ref{DC_Output_table} lists the format options and files created.
The column labeled ``Additional Columns'' lists the additional data that
is written, though not specified on the \texttt{.PRINT} line.

\section{Transient Analysis}
\label{Trans_Overview}
\label{Transient_Analysis}
\index{analysis!transient} \index{transient analysis}
\index{\texttt{.TRAN}}

The transient response analysis simulates the response of the circuit
from \texttt{TIME=0} to a specified time.  Throughout a transient
analysis, any or all of the independent sources may have
time-dependent values.

In \Xyce{} (and most other circuit simulators), the transient analysis
begins by performing its own bias point\index{bias point} calculation
at the beginning of the run, using the same method as used for DC
sweep. This is required to set the initial conditions for the
transient solution as the initial values of the sources may differ
from their DC values.

\subsection{.TRAN Statement}

To run a transient simulation, the circuit netlist file must contain a
\verb|.TRAN| command.

\Example{\\
\texttt{ .TRAN 100us 300ms } \\
\texttt{ .TRAN 100p 12.05u 9.95u }
}

The \Xyce{} Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{} provides a detailed
explanation of the \verb|.TRAN| statement. The netlist must also
contain one of the following:

\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Independent, transient source (see table~\ref{Time_Sources}),
\item Initial condition on a reactive element, or
\item Time-dependent analog behavioral modeling source (see chapter~\ref{Behavioral_Modeling})
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsection{Defining a Time-Dependent (transient) Source}
\label{Defining_Source}
\index{sources!defining time-dependent}

\subsubsection{Overview of Source Elements}

Source\index{sources} elements, either voltage or current, are entered
in the netlist\index{netlist!sources} file as described in the \Xyce{}
Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{}.  Table~\ref{Time_Sources} lists the
time-dependent sources available in \Xyce{} for either voltage or
current.  For voltage sources, the name is preceded by \texttt{V} while
current sources are preceded by \texttt{I}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{Summary of \Xyce{}-supported time-dependent sources \label{Time_Sources}}
  \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|Y|Y|}
    \rowcolor{XyceDarkBlue} \color{white}\bf Source Element Name &
    \color{white}\bf Description \\ \hline

    EXP & Exponential Waveform \\ \hline
    PAT & Pattern Waveform \\ \hline
    PULSE & Pulse Waveform \\ \hline
    PWL & Piecewise Linear Waveform \\ \hline
    SFFM & Frequency-modulated Waveform \\ \hline
    SIN & Sinusoidal Waveform \\ \hline

  \end{tabularx}
\index{sources!time-dependent}
\end{table}

To use time-dependent or transient sources, place the source element
line in the netlist and characterize the transient behavior using the
appropriate parameters.  Each transient source element has a separate
set of parameters dependent on its transient behavior.  In this way,
the user can create analog sources that produce sine wave, square
pulse, exponential pulse, single-frequency FM, and piecewise linear
(PWL) waveforms.

\subsubsection{Defining Transient Sources}

To define a transient source, select one of the supported sources:
independent voltage or current, choose a transient source type from
table~\ref{Time_Sources}, and provide the transient parameters (refer
to the \Xyce{} Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{} to fully define the
source).

The following example of an independent sinusoidal voltage source in a
circuit netlist creates a voltage source between nodes 1 and 5
that oscillates sinusoidally between -5V and +5V with a frequency of
50 KHz.  The arguments specify an offset of -5V, a 10V amplitude, and
a 50KHz frequency, in that order.

\Example{\texttt{Vexample 1 5 SIN(-5V 10V 50K)}}


\subsection{Transient Time Steps}
\label{Time_Steps}
\index{solvers!transient} \index{time step!size}

During the simulation, \Xyce{} uses a calculated time step that is
continuously adjusted for accuracy and efficiency
(see~\cite{WKHH:2000} and ~\cite{Petzold:1996}).  Calculation time
step increases during periods of circuit idleness, and decreases
during dynamic portions of the waveform.  \index{time step!maximum
  size} Users may control the maximum internal step size by specifying
the step's ceiling value in the \verb|.TRAN| command (see the \Xyce{}
Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{}).

The internal calculation time steps used might not be consistent with
the user-requested \index{output!time values} output time steps.  By
default, \Xyce{} outputs solution results at every time step it
calculates.  If the user selects output timesteps via the
\verb|.OPTIONS OUTPUT| statement (see chapter~\ref{Output}), then
\Xyce{} will output results at the interval requested, interpolating
solution variables to desired output times if necessary.


\subsection{Time Integration Methods}
\label{TransientControls}
\index{solvers!transient} \index{time step!size}

For a transient analysis, several time integration methods can be
selected to solve the circuit model's differential algebraic
equations.  The following algorithms are available:

\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Variable order Trapezoidal (combines Trapezoidal and Backward Euler) 
\item Gear method, orders 1-2.
\end{XyceItemize}




You can set the \verb|method|, \verb|maxord| and \verb|minord|
parameters to select the time integration methods via a .OPTIONS
line. The following table shows the possible settings for those three
parameters. (Note: Consult the \Xyce{} Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide
for the exact syntax of the .OPTIONS line for each time integration
method.) The default time integration method in \Xyce{} is Trap, which
is the same as SPICE, PSpice and HSPICE.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{Summary of \Xyce{}-supported time integration methods \label{Time_integration}}
  \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|Y|Y|Y|}
    \rowcolor{XyceDarkBlue} \color{white}\bf  Integration Methods &
    \color{white}\bf  Option Settings & \color{white}\bf Comments \\ \hline
    Backward-Euler & method=trap maxord=1 & Backward-Euler only \\ \hline
    Trap & method=trap & combines Trapezoidal and Backward Euler (default) \\ \hline
    Trap only & method=trap minord=2 & Trapezoidal only \\ \hline
    Gear &  method=gear &  combines Backward Euler and 2nd order Gear \\ \hline
    Gear2 only &  method=gear minord=2 & 2nd order Gear only  \\ \hline
  \end{tabularx}
\index{Time integration!integration method}
\index{\texttt{.OPTIONS}!\texttt{TIMEINT}!\texttt{METHOD}} \index{\texttt{.OPTIONS}!\texttt{TIMEINT}!\texttt{MINORD}} 
\end{table}



The Trapezoidal method is often the preferred method because it is
accurate and fast.  However, this method can exhibit artificial
point-to-point ringing, which can be controlled by using tighter
tolerances. If a circuit fails to converge with the Trapezoidal method
then you can re-run the transient analysis using the Gear method.

The Gear method may help convergence for some circuits. The 2nd order
Gear method is typically more accurate than the Backward-Euler method
(1st order Gear). However, both of these methods are overly stable
methods, and they can damp the actual circuit behavior when simulating
high-Q resonators such as oscillators.  The Backward-Euler method has
more damping effect than the 2nd order Gear method.  This effect can
be alleviated by using tighter tolerances in the simulations. However,
it is suggested to use the pure Trapezoidal method for oscillators.

\subsection{Error Controls}
\label{Time_Step_Selection}
\index{solvers!transient} \index{time step!size} \index{time step!how to select}

There are two basic time-step error control methods in \Xyce{} ---
Local Truncation Error (LTE) based and non-LTE based.


\subsubsection{Local Truncation Error (LTE) Strategy}
\index{\texttt{.OPTIONS}!\texttt{TIMEINT}!\texttt{RELTOL}} \index{\texttt{.OPTIONS}!\texttt{TIMEINT}!\texttt{ABSTOL}}

All time integration methods use the LTE-based strategy by
default. The accuracy of the simulation can be controlled by
specifying appropriate relative and absolute error tolerances (RELTOL
and ABSTOL).

\Example{\\
\texttt{ .OPTIONS TIMEINT RELTOL=1e-4 ABSTOL=1e-8 } \\
}

The total tolerance of LTE is
{\\
\texttt{ $Tol_{LTE}$  = abstol +  reltol*ref}  
}

The parameter \verb|ref| is the reference value that the relative
error is compared to. It can be controlled by setting \verb|newlte|
option.

\index{\texttt{.OPTIONS}!\texttt{TIMEINT}!\texttt{NEWLTE}}
\Example{\\
\texttt{ .OPTIONS TIMEINT NEWLTE=1 } \\
}

The  choices for \verb|newlte| option are:

\begin{XyceItemize} 
\item 0. The reference value is the current value on each node. This is the most conservative and least used.
\item 1. The reference value is the maximum of all the signals at the current time. This is the default value.
\item 2. The reference value is the maximum of all the signals over all past time. This is the loosest criterion. It normally produces the best performance and should be used if the overall size of the signals is roughly the same on all nodes.
\item 3. The reference value is the maximum value on each signal over all past time. This should be used if the scale of signals varies widely in a system.
\end{XyceItemize}

The Trapezoid integrator algorithm introduces no numerical
dissipation.  So, a strong ringing (artificially introduced by the
numerical algorithm) will occur when sources or models introduce
discontinuities.  This can result in a large local truncation error
estimate, ultimately leading to a ``time-step too small'' error.  In
this case, using the Gear method or a non-LTE strategy may help.

\subsubsection{Non-LTE Strategy}
The non-LTE strategy used in \Xyce{} is based on success of the
nonlinear solve, and is enabled by setting ERROPTION=1.  Since the
step-size selection is based only upon nonlinear iteration statistics
rather than accuracy, it is highly suggested that DELMAX be specified,
in a circuit-specific manner, for all three time integrators.  The
purpose of DELMAX is to limit the largest time step taken.

\Example{\\
\texttt{ .OPTIONS TIMEINT ERROPTION=1 DELMAX=1.0e-4 } \\
}

For the Trapezoid and Gear integrators, the options are slightly more
refined.  If the number of nonlinear iterations is below NLMIN, then
the step size is doubled. If the number of nonlinear iterations is
above NLMAX then the step size is cut by one eighth.  In between, the
step size is not changed.  An example using Trap (METHOD=7) is given
below.  \index{\texttt{.OPTIONS}!\texttt{TIMEINT}!\texttt{NLMIN}}
\index{\texttt{.OPTIONS}!\texttt{TIMEINT}!\texttt{NLMAX}}
\index{\texttt{.OPTIONS}!\texttt{TIMEINT}!\texttt{DELMAX}}

\Example{\\
\texttt{ .OPTIONS TIMEINT METHOD=7 ERROPTION=1 NLMIN=3 NLMAX=8 DELMAX=1.0e-4 } \\
}

If the number of Newton iterations is bigger than NLmax and
TIMESTEPSREVERSAL is not set, then \Xyce{} will cut the next step.  If
the number of Newton iterations is bigger than NLmax and
TIMESTEPSREVERSAL is set, then \Xyce{} will reject the current step
and also cut the current step.

\Example{\\
\texttt{ .OPTIONS TIMEINT METHOD=7 ERROPTION=1 DELMAX=1.0e-4 TIMESTEPSREVERSAL=1 } \\
}

\subsection{Breakpoints}

\index{\texttt{.OPTIONS}!\texttt{TIMEINT}!\texttt{BREAKPOINTS}} 

It is often necessary or desirable for the time integrator to be
forced to land on a specific time point and restart integration from
that point.  The most common scenario for which this is necessary is
when an device (such as a \texttt{PULSE} or a \texttt{PWL} source)
produces a discontinuity.  If a discontinuity is present, and no
breakpoint is set, then the LTE analysis will force the time
integrator to take really small time steps, and this can possibly
impact the robustness of the calculation.

Fortunately, \Xyce{} handles most device-based discontinuities
automatically, so it is not necessary for the user to worry about
them.  However, it can be desirable for the user to manually set
breakpoints from the netlist.  In a \Xyce{} netlist, these are
specified using the BREAKPOINTS parameter with a comma-separated list
in the following \texttt{.OPTIONS TIMEINT} statement.

\Example{\\
\texttt{ .OPTIONS TIMEINT BREAKPOINTS=1ms,2ms,3ms} \\
}

\subsection{Checkpointing and Restarting}
\label{Restart}
\index{checkpoint} \index{restart}

\Xyce{} was designed to simulate large, complex circuits over long
simulation runs.  Because complex simulations can take many hours (or
even days) to complete, it can sometimes be helpful to use
``checkpointing.''  When checkpointing is used, \Xyce{} periodically
saves its complete simulation state.  The saved state can be used to
restart \Xyce{} from one of these ``checkpoints.''  In the event of a
computer crash, power outage, or should the simulation need to be
interrupted for some other reason, checkpointing allows the user to
restart a long simulation in the middle of a run without having to
start over.

\Xyce{} uses the \index{netlist!restart} \index{\texttt{.OPTIONS}!\texttt{RESTART}} \verb|.OPTIONS RESTART|
netlist command to control all checkpoint output and restarting.  

\subsubsection{Checkpointing Command Format}
\index{checkpoint!format} \index{restart!format} \index{\texttt{.OPTIONS}!\texttt{RESTART}}

\begin{XyceItemize}
\item \verb+.OPTIONS RESTART [PACK=<0|1>] JOB=<job name> INITIAL_INTERVAL=<interval>+ \\
  \verb+[[<t0> <i0> [<t1> <i1>...]]]+

  \texttt{PACK=<0|1>} indicates whether restart data files will contain byte-packed (binary) data(\texttt{PACK=1}, the default) or unpacked (ASCII)(\texttt{PACK=0}).
  \texttt{JOB=<job name>} identifies the prefix for restart files.  The actual restart files will be the job name appended with the current simulation time (e.g., \texttt{name1e-05} for \texttt{JOB=name} and simulation time 1e-05 seconds).  Furthermore, the\\ \texttt{INITIAL\_INTERVAL=<interval>} identifies the initial interval time used for restart output; this parameter must be given.  The \texttt{<tx ix>} intervals identify times (\texttt{tx}) at which the output interval (\texttt{ix}) will change.  This functionality is identical to that described for the \index{\texttt{.OPTIONS}!\texttt{OUTPUT}}
  \texttt{.OPTIONS OUTPUT} command (section~\ref{Output_Control}).
\item Example --- Generate checkpoints every 0.1 $\mu s$:
\begin{vquote}
.OPTIONS RESTART JOB=checkpt INITIAL_INTERVAL=0.1us
\end{vquote}
\item Example --- Generate unpacked checkpoints every 0.1 $\mu s$:
\begin{vquote}
.OPTIONS RESTART PACK=0 JOB=checkpt INITIAL_INTERVAL=0.1us
\end{vquote}
\item Example --- Initial interval of 0.1 $\mu s$, at 1 $\mu s$ in the
  simulation, change to interval of 0.5 $\mu s$, and at 10 $\mu s$ change to an
  interval of 0.1 $\mu s$:
\begin{vquote}
.OPTIONS RESTART JOB=checkpt INITIAL_INTERVAL=0.1us 1us 0.5us
+ 10us 0.1us
\end{vquote}
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection{Restarting Command Format}
\index{restart!format}

\begin{XyceItemize}
\item \index{\texttt{.OPTIONS}!\texttt{RESTART}}
\verb+.OPTIONS RESTART <FILE=<filename> | JOB=<job name> START_TIME=<time>>+ \\
\verb|+ [INITIAL_INTERVAL=<interval> [<t0> <i0> [<t1> <i1> ...]]]|
\end{XyceItemize}
To restart\index{restart} from an existing restart file, specify the file by using either the\\%
\texttt{FILE=<filename>} parameter to explicitly request a file or\\%
\texttt{JOB=<job name> START\_TIME=<time>} to specify a file prefix and a
specific time.  The time must exactly match an output file time for the
simulator to correctly load the file.  

To continue checkpointing the simulation in a restarted run, append
\texttt{INITIAL\_INTERVAL=<interval>} and the following intervals to
the command in the same format as previously described.  Without these
additional parameters, the simulation will restart as requested, but
will not generate further checkpoint files.

\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Example\index{Example!restarting} --- Restart from checkpoint file at 0.133
  $\mu s$:
\begin{vquote}
.OPTIONS RESTART JOB=checkpt START_TIME=0.133us
\end{vquote}
\item Example --- Restart from checkpoint file at 0.133 $\mu s$ :
\begin{vquote}
.OPTIONS RESTART FILE=checkpt0.000000133
\end{vquote}
\item Example --- Restart from 0.133 $\mu s$ and continue checkpointing at 0.1
      $\mu s$ intervals:
\begin{vquote}
.OPTIONS RESTART FILE=checkpt0.000000133 JOB=checkpt_again
+ INITIAL_INTERVAL=0.1us
\end{vquote}
\end{XyceItemize}
\subsection{Output}
\label{Transient_Output}\index{\texttt{.PRINT}!\texttt{TRAN}}

During analysis a number of output files may be generated.  The
selection of which files are created depends on a variety of factors,
most obvious of which is the \texttt{.PRINT} command.
Table~\ref{Tran_Output_table} lists the format options and files
created.  The column labeled ``Additional Columns'' lists the additional

\index{\texttt{.STEP}}

The \verb|.STEP| command performs a parametric sweep for all the
analyses of the circuit.  When the \verb|.STEP| command is invoked,
typical analyses, such as \verb|.DC|, \verb|.AC|, and \verb|.TRAN| are
performed for each value of the stepped parameter.

This capability is very similar, but not identical, to the \verb|STEP|
capability in PSpice~\cite{PSpiceUG:1998}.  \Xyce{} can use
\verb|.STEP| to sweep over any device instance or device model
parameter, as well as the circuit temperature.  It is not legal to
sweep parameters defined in \texttt{.PARAM} statements, but it is
legal to sweep global parameters defined in \texttt{.global\_param}
statements.  Section~\ref{Parameters_Expressions}) discusses these two
distinct parameter definitions.

\subsection{.STEP Statement}

A \verb|.STEP| analysis may be specified by simply adding a
\verb|.STEP| line to a netlist.  Unlike \verb|.DC|, \verb|.STEP| by
itself is not an adequate analysis specification, as it merely
specifies an outer loop around the normal analysis.  A standard
analysis line, either specifying \verb|.TRAN|, \verb|.AC| and
\verb|.DC| analysis, is still required.

Some examples of typical \verb|.STEP| lines are:

\Example{\\
\texttt{ .STEP M1:L  7u 5u -1u } \\
\texttt{ .STEP OCT V0 0.125 64 2 } \\
\texttt{ .STEP DEC R1 100 10000 3 } \\
\texttt{ .STEP TEMP LIST 10.0 15.0 18.0 27.0 33.0 } \\
\texttt{ .STEP data=table }
}

\verb|.STEP| has a format similar to that of the \verb|.DC| format
specification.  In the first example, \verb|M1:L| is the name of the
parameter (in this instance, the length parameter of the MOSFET
\texttt{M1}), \verb|7u| is the initial value of the parameter,
\verb|5u| is the final value of the parameter, and \verb|-1u| is the
step size.  Like \verb|.DC|, \verb|.STEP| in \Xyce{} can also handle
sweeps by decade, octave, a specified lists of values, or multivariate parameter values from a table.  Consult the
\Xyce{} Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{} for complete explanations of each sweep type.

\subsection{Sweeping over a Device Instance Parameter}
\label{step_InstanceParam}

The first example uses \verb|M1:L| as the parameter, but it could have
used any model or instance parameter existing in the
circuit. Internally, \Xyce{} handles the parameters for all device
models and device instances in the same way.  Users can uniquely
identify any parameter by specifying the device instance name,
followed by a colon (:), followed by the specific parameter name.  For
example, all the MOSFET models have an instance parameter for the
channel length, L.  For a MOSFET instance specified in a netlist,
named M1, the full name for the M1 channel length parameter is M1:L.

Figure~\ref{Step_Netlist_1} provides a simple application of
\verb|.STEP| to a device instance.  This is the same diode clipper
circuit as was used in the transient analysis chapter, except that a
single line (in red) has been added.  This \verb|.STEP| line will
cause \Xyce{} to sweep the resistance of the resistor, R4, from 3.0
KOhms to 15.0 KOhms, in 2.0 KOhms increments, meaning seven transient
simulations will be performed, each one with a different value for R4.

As the circuit is executed multiple times, the resulting output file
is a little more sophisticated.  The \verb|.PRINT| statement is still
used in much the same way as before.  However, the .prn output file
contains the concatenated output of each \verb|.STEP| increment.  The
end of this section provides more details of how \texttt{.STEP}
changes output files.

\subsection{Sweeping over a Device Model Parameter}
\label{step_ModelParam}

Sweeping a model parameter can be done in an identical manner to an
instance parameter.  Figure~\ref{Step_Netlist_2} contains the same
circuit as in figure~\ref{Step_Netlist_1}, but with additional
\verb|.STEP| line referring to a model parameter, \verb|D1N3940:IS|.

NOTE: \verb|.STEP| line syntax differs from \verb|.DC| line syntax in
that multiple parameters require separate \verb|.STEP| lines. Each
parameter needs a separate line.

\subsection{Sweeping over Temperature}
\label{step_Temperature}

It is also possible to sweep over temperature.  To do so, simply
specify \verb|temp| as the parameter name.  It will work in the same
manner as \verb|.STEP| when applied to model and instance parameters.

\subsection{Special cases: Sweeping Independent Sources, Resistors, Capacitors and Inductors}
\label{step_SpecialCases}

For some devices, there is generally only one parameter that one would
want to sweep.  For example, a linear resistor's only parameter of
interest is resistance, R.  Similarly, for a DC voltage or current
source, one is usually only interested in the magnitude of the source,
DCV0.  Finally, linear capacitors generally only have capacitance, C,
as a parameter of interest, while inductors generally only have
inductance, L, as a parameter of interest.

For these simple devices, it is not necessary to specify both the
parameter and device on the \texttt{.STEP} line: only the device name
is strictly required, as these devices have default parameters that
are assumed if no parameter name is given explicitly.

Examples of usage are given below.  The first two lines are equivalent
--- in the first line, the resistance parameter of \texttt{R4} is
named explicitly, and in the second line the resistance parameter is
implicit. A similar example is then shown for the DC voltage of the
voltage source \texttt{VCC}.  In the remaining lines, parameter names
are all implicit, and the default parameters of the associated devices
are used.

\Example{ \\
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
  \texttt{.STEP R4:R} &\texttt{3.0K}  &\texttt{15.0K}  &\texttt{2.0K} \\ 
  \texttt{.STEP R4} &\texttt{3.0K}  &\texttt{15.0K}  &\texttt{2.0K} \\
  \texttt{.STEP VCC:DCV0}&\texttt{4.0 }  &\texttt{ 6.0 }  &\texttt{1.0 } \\  
  \texttt{.STEP VCC}&\texttt{4.0 }  &\texttt{ 6.0 }  &\texttt{1.0 } \\ 
  \texttt{.STEP ICC}&\texttt{4.0 }  &\texttt{ 6.0 }  &\texttt{1.0 } \\ 
  \texttt{.STEP C1} &\texttt{0.45u} &\texttt{ 0.50u} &\texttt{0.1u} \\
  \texttt{.STEP L1} &\texttt{0.5m} &\texttt{ 1.0m} &\texttt{0.5m} \\
\end{tabular}
        }

Independent sources require further explanation.  Their default
parameter, DCV0, only applies to \texttt{.DC} analyses.  They do not have
default parameters for their transient forms, such as \texttt{SIN}
or \texttt{PULSE}.

\subsection{Output files}
\label{step_output_files}
\index{output!\texttt{.STEP}}

Users can think of \texttt{.STEP} simulations as several distinct
executions of the same circuit netlist.  The output data, as specified
by a \texttt{.PRINT} line, however, goes to a single (\texttt{*.prn})
file.  For convenience, \Xyce{} also creates a second auxilliary file
with the \texttt{*.res} suffix.

Figure~\ref{Step_Netlist_1} shows an example file named
\verb+clip.cir+, which when run will produce files \verb+clip.cir.res+
and \verb+clip.cir.prn+.  The file \verb+clip.cir.res+ contains one
line for each step, showing what parameter value was used on that
step.  \verb+clip.cir.prn+ is the familiar output format, but the
\verb+INDEX+ field recycles to zero each time a new step begins.  As
the default behavior distinguishes each step's output only by
recycling the \verb+INDEX+ field to zero, it can be beneficial to add
the sweep parameters to the \verb+.PRINT+ line.  For the default file
format (\texttt{format=std}), \Xyce{} will not automatically include
these sweep parameters, so for plotting it is usually best to specify
them by hand.

If using the default \texttt{.prn} file format (\texttt{format=std}),
the resulting \texttt{.STEP} simulation output file will be a simple
concatenation of each step's underlying analysis output.  If using
\texttt{format=probe}, the data for each execution of the circuit will
be in distinct sections of the file, and it should be easy to plot the
results using PROBE.  If using \texttt{format=tecplot}, the results of
each \texttt{.STEP} simulation will be in a distinct Tecplot
zone. Finally, format=raw will place the results for each
\texttt{.STEP} simulation in a distinct ``plot'' region.

\section{Harmonic Balance Analysis}
\label{HB_Analysis}
\label{HB_Overview}
\index{analysis!HB} \index{Harmonic Balance Analysis}
\index{\texttt{.HB}}

Harmonic balance (HB) is a technique that solves for the steady state
solution of nonlinear circuits in the frequency domain. In harmonic
balance simulation, voltages and currents in a nonlinear circuit are
represented by truncated Fourier series. HB directly computes the
frequency spectrum of voltages and currents at the steady state
solution. This can be more efficient than transient analysis in
applications where a transient analysis may take a long time to reach
the steady state solution.  In particular, HB is well suited for
simulating analog RF and microwave circuits.

HB supports an unlimited number of independent input tones for driven
circuits in both serial and parallel builds of \Xyce{}. The output of
HB analysis is the real and imaginary components of voltages and
currents in the frequency domain. \Xyce{} also provides time domain
responses of a circuit. By default, the numbers of samples in both
time and frequency domain outputs are the same.  However, the number
of time domain samples can be much larger than the number of frequency
domain samples by setting \verb|numtpts| in
\verb|.options hbint|. This enables the users to use a small number of
harmonics for each tone and produce well-resolved results in time
domain.

For HB analysis, an initial guess of the solution is required. Often,
a good initial guess is necessary for HB to converge. By default,
\Xyce{} uses transient analysis to determine the initial guess, often
called ``Transient Assisted HB''.  This option is controlled by the
parameter, \verb|TAHB|, which is enabled if \verb|TAHB=1| and disabled
if \verb|TAHB=0| in \verb|.options hbint|. If enabled, the starting
time of the transient analysis can be modified by specifying the
parameter \verb|STARTUPPERIODS| in \verb|.options hbint|. The \Xyce{}
Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{} provides a detailed explanation of
the HB options.

\subsection{.HB Statement}

To run a HB simulation, the circuit netlist file must contain a \verb|.HB| command.

\Example{\\
\texttt{.HB 1e4} \\
\texttt{.HB 1e4 2e2}
}

The parameters following \verb|.HB| are the fundamental frequencies and {\bf must} be
specified by the user. The \Xyce{} Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{} provides a detailed 
explanation of the \verb|.HB| statement.


\subsection{HB Options}

Key parameters for \verb|.HB| simulation can be specified by
\verb|.options hbint|.
 
\Example{\\

\texttt{.options hbint numfreq=5,3 STARTUPPERIODS=2 tahb=1 intmodmax=3  numtpts=100} \\
\texttt{.HB 1e4 2e2} 
} 

As shown in the example, \texttt{numfreq} specifies the number of
harmonics to be calculated for each tone. It must have the same number
of entries as the fundamental frequencies in the \verb|.HB| statement.
This example shows the options for a two tone HB analysis.  The
\verb|.HB| statement is \texttt{ .HB $f_1$ $f_2$ }. For the first tone
$f_1$, 5 harmonics are used and for the second tone $f_2$, 3 harmonics
are used.

The \texttt{intmodmax} option is the maximum intermodulation product
order used in the spectrum.

As stated above, \texttt{TAHB} is the Transient Assisted HB option. In
the case of multi-tone HB analysis, the initial guess is generated by
a single tone transient simulation.  The single tone that is used is
the first tone in the \verb|.HB| statement.  So, when ordering the
fundamental frequencies in the \verb|.HB| statement, the first tone
should be the frequency that produces the most nonlinear response by
the circuit.

As stated above, the \texttt{STARTUPPERIODS} option specifies the
number of time periods that \Xyce{} will integrate through using
normal transient analysis \textbf{before} generating the initial
conditions for HB analysis.  For this example, \Xyce{} will integrate
through two periods before computing the initial conditions, which
requires an additional period.  Thus, \Xyce{} will integrate through a
total of three periods to compute the initial guess for HB analysis.

The \texttt{numtpts} option specifies the number of time points in the
output. The number of samples in the time domain output is an odd
number. If an even number is specified, the number of time points will
be \texttt{numtpts} plus one. For this example, the time domain output
has $101$ samples.

\Example{\\
\texttt{.options hbint numfreq=20 STARTUPPERIODS=2}
}

For the single tone example given above, this statement will return
$20$ negative and $20$ positive harmonics plus the DC component.

The \Xyce{} Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{} provides a detailed
explanation of the \verb|.options hbint|.

\subsubsection{Nonlinear Solver Options}

The HB analysis uses a different set of default nonlinear solver
parameters than that of transient and DC analysis. Nonlinear solver
parameters for HB analysis can be specified by using
\verb|.options nonlin-hb|.

\Example{\\
\texttt{.options nonlin-hb abstol=1e-6}
}

The \Xyce{} Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{} provides a detailed
explanation of the \verb|.options nonlin-hb| statement.

\subsubsection{Linear Solver Options}

The HB analysis provided by \Xyce{} can employ both iterative and
direct solvers.  If iterative solvers are used, then the HB Jacobian
matrix is not assembled and only HB-specific preconditioners can be
used for this matrix-free approach.  If direct solvers are used, then
the HB Jacobian is assembled and the complex-valued matrix is solved
using the selected method.  Direct solvers are memory intensive and
computationally expensive, so it is suggested that they are only used
when iterative methods fail during HB analysis.  You can set iterative
solver and preconditioner options using the \verb|.options linsol-hb|
statement.

\Example{\\
\texttt{.options linsol-hb type=aztecoo prec\_type=block\_jacobi AZ\_tol=1e-9}
}

In this example, \texttt{type} specifies the iterative solver to use
in the HB analysis and \texttt{AZ\_tol} is the relative tolerance for
the iterative solver.  Any of the iterative solver options in
section~\ref{LinearSolver_Options} are valid.  However,
\texttt{prec\_type} specifies which HB-specific preconditioner to
use. The choices for this option are \texttt{none} and
\texttt{block\_jacobi} (default).

\subsection{Output}
\label{HB_Output}\index{\texttt{.PRINT}!\texttt{HB}}

HB analysis can generate a variety of output files.  The selection of
which files are generated most often depends on what is specified for
the \texttt{.PRINT HB} command.  Table~\ref{HB_Output_table} lists the
format options and files created.  The column labeled ``Additional
Columns'' lists the additional data that is written, though not
specified on the \texttt{.PRINT HB} line.

\texttt{.OP} & \emph{log-file} & Operating point information \\ \hline

  \end{tabularx}
%% \index{sources!time-dependent}
\end{table}

\subsection{User Guidance}

One of the most common errors in the HB simulation setup is the use of
too few harmonic frequencies (i.e., \texttt{numfreq} is too
small). One way to determine the optimum number of harmonic
frequencies is to first simulate the circuit with a small
\texttt{numfreq}, then increase the \texttt{numfreq} until the
solution stops changing within a significant bound.  Requesting too
many harmonic frequencies is wasteful of memory and simulation time,
so it is not practical to request a very high \texttt{numfreq} either.

\section{AC Analysis}
\label{AC_Analysis}
\label{AC_Sweep_Overview}
\index{analysis!AC} \index{AC analysis} \index{\texttt{.AC}}
\index{AC sweep} \index{analysis!AC sweep}

The AC small-signal analysis of \Xyce{} computes AC output variables
as a function of frequency. The program first computes the DC
operating point of the circuit and linearizes the circuit. The
resultant linear circuit is then analyzed over a user-specified range
of frequencies. The desired output of an AC small-signal analysis is
usually a transfer function (voltage gain, transimpedance, etc). If
the circuit has one AC input, it is convenient to set that input to
unity and zero phase so output variables have the same value as the
transfer function of the output variable with respect to input.

\subsection{.AC Statement}

One may specify \verb|.AC| analyses by adding a \verb|.AC| line in the
netlist.  Some examples of typical \verb|.AC| lines include:

\Example{\\ 
\texttt{.AC DEC 10 1K 100MEG}  \\
\texttt{.AC DEC 10 1 10K}  \\
\texttt{.AC LIN 100 1 100HZ } \\
\texttt{.AC DATA=table }
}

These examples include some types of sweep (linear, decade and data).
The \Xyce{} Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{} provides a complete
description of all types of sweep.  Note that \texttt{DATA} is a
special case, which will allow sweeping of frequency, magnitude, phase
and linear model parameters simultaneously.

\subsection{AC Voltage and Current Sources}
\label{AC_Sources}
\index{AC sweep!sources}

\Xyce{} assumes the AC source to be a cosine waveform at a specified
phase angle. Its frequency must be defined in a separate ``.AC''
command defining the frequency for all the sources in the circuit. The
unique information for the individual source is the name (which must
start with ``V'' or ``I''), the node numbers, the magnitude of the
source, and its phase angle. Some examples are as follows:

\Example{\\   
%\texttt{*name nodelist type value  phase(deg)}  \\
\texttt{Vac   4   1    AC   120V    30}  \\
\texttt{Vin 1 0 1.44 ac .1  }  \\
\texttt{Iin 1 0 1.44e-5 ac 0.1e-5 sin(0 1 1e+5 0 0)} 
}

NOTE: The type, AC, must be specified because the default is DC. If
not specified, \Xyce{} assumes the phase angle to be zero degrees.
The units of the phase angle are in degrees.

%%%%%
\subsection{Example}
An example AC analysis netlist is given in figure~\ref{acExample}.
This particular example uses a \texttt{.data} statement to specify a
more complicated sweep.  Each line of the data table corresponds to a
different sweep point, so there are 3 points evaluated, and there is a
different magnitude, phase, frequency and resistance for each point.

\subsubsection{Linear Solver Options}

The AC analysis provided by \Xyce{} can employ both iterative and
direct solvers. You can set direct, iterative
solver, and preconditioner options using the \verb|.options linsol-ac|
statement.

\Example{\\
\texttt{.options linsol-ac type=ksparse}
}

In this example, \texttt{type} specifies a non-default direct solver
to use in the AC analysis.  Any of the direct and iterative solver options in
section~\ref{LinearSolver_Options} are valid. 

%%%%%
\subsection{Output}
\label{AC_Output}\index{\texttt{.PRINT}!\texttt{AC}}

During analysis a number of output files may be generated.  The
selection of which files are created depends on a variety of factors,
most obvious of which is the \texttt{.PRINT} command.
Table~\ref{AC_Output_table} lists the format options and files created.
The column labeled ``Additional Columns'' lists the additional data that
is written, though not specified on the \texttt{.PRINT} line.

%\subsection{Using the .PRINT AC Command}
\label{AC_print}
\index{AC sweep!print}

Running \Xyce{} on AC analysis produces an output results file named
\verb|.cir.FD.prn|. Obtaining this file requires that the
\verb|.PRINT AC| line be specified.

\Xyce{} supports printing the real and imaginary parts of phasor
values (complex numbers) for AC analysis output as voltages or
currents. For instance, specify ``V(1)'' to print the real part and
imaginary part of a voltage at node 1. Additional output variable
formats are also available:
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item \texttt{VR(<circuit node>)} output the real component of the voltage response
\item \texttt{VI(<circuit node>)} output the imaginary component of voltage response
\item \texttt{VM(<circuit node>)} output the magnitude of voltage response
\item \texttt{VDB(<circuit node>)} output the magnitude of voltage response in decibels
\item \texttt{VP(<circuit node>)} output the phase of voltage response, in degrees
\end{XyceItemize}

Some examples are as follows: 
\Example{\\ 
\texttt{.print AC V(3) }\\
\texttt{.print AC VI(15)}\\
\texttt{.print AC VP(OUTPUT)} \\
\texttt{.print AC \{Re(V(OUTPUT))\} } \\
\texttt{.print AC \{Img(V(OUTPUT))\} }
}

As shown in the examples, the expression library can handle both real and complex valued solution variables.
See the \Xyce{} Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{} for more details.

\section{NOISE Analysis}
\label{NOISE_Analysis}
\label{NOISE_Sweep_Overview}
\index{analysis!NOISE} \index{NOISE analysis}\index{\texttt{.NOISE}}
\index{NOISE sweep} \index{analysis!NOISE sweep}

\Xyce{} supports small-signal noise analysis, which is closely related
to AC analysis. For noise analysis, input and output noise is computed
for a specified output node, relative to an input source, as a
function of frequency.

The program first computes the DC operating point of the circuit and
linearizes the circuit.  Next, at each frequency, an AC calculation is
performed to obtain the AC gain.  This gain is used later to compute
the equivalent input noise from the output noise.  After the AC gain
is computed, the noise calculation is performed at the current
frequency using the adjoint method.  This involves solving the
transpose of the AC matrix.


If the circuit has one NOISE input, it is convenient to set that input
to unity and zero phase so output variables have the same value as the
transfer function of the output variable with respect to the input.

\subsection{.NOISE Statement}

One may specify \verb|.NOISE| analyses by adding a \verb|.NOISE| line in the netlist.  
Some examples of typical \verb|.NOISE| lines include:

\Example{\\ 
\texttt{.NOISE V(5) VIN LIN 101 100Hz 200Hz} \\
\texttt{.NOISE V(5,3) V1 OCT 10 1kHz 16kHz} \\
\texttt{.NOISE V(4) V2 DEC 20 1MEG 100MEG} \\
\texttt{.NOISE V(4) V2 DATA=table}
}

The .NOISE command can specify a linear sweep, decade logarithmic
sweep, octave logarithmic sweep, or a data table of multivariate
values. See the \Xyce{} Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{} for details.

\subsection{NOISE Voltage and Current Sources}
\label{NOISE_Sources}
\index{NOISE sweep!sources}

Noise analysis requires a reference AC source.  \Xyce{} assumes the AC
source to be a cosine waveform at a specified phase angle. Its
frequency must be defined in a separate ``.NOISE'' command defining
the frequency for all the sources in the circuit. The unique
information for the individual source is the name (which must start
with ``V'' or ``I''), the node numbers, the magnitude of the source,
and its phase angle. Some examples are as follows:

\Example{\\   
%\texttt{*name nodelist type value  phase(deg)}  \\
\texttt{Vac   4   1  AC   120V    30}  \\
\texttt{Vin 1 0 1.44 ac .1  }  \\
\texttt{Iin 1 0 1.44e-5 ac 0.1e-5 sin(0 1 1e+5 0 0)} 
}

NOTE: The type, AC, must be specified because the default is DC. If
not specified, \Xyce{} assumes the phase angle to be zero degrees.
The units of the phase angle are in degrees.

\subsection{Examples}

Example noise analysis netlists are given in
figures~\ref{noiseExample} and \ref{noiseExampleWData}.  In those two
examples, the only noise source is the resistor, \texttt{rlp1}.  The
input source is \texttt{v1} and the output node is \texttt{v(4)}.  A
decade sweep is used in the first example, while a \texttt{.DATA}
statement is used in the second example.

\subsection{Output}
\label{NOISE_Output}\index{\texttt{.PRINT}!\texttt{NOISE}}

During analysis a number of output files may be generated.  The
selection of which files are created depends on a variety of factors,
most obvious of which is the \texttt{.PRINT} command.
Table~\ref{NOISE_Output_table} lists the format options and files
created.  The column labeled ``Additional Columns'' lists the
additional data that is written, though not specified on the
\texttt{.PRINT} line.

\begin{table}[htbp]

  \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

%\subsection{Using the .PRINT NOISE Command}
\label{NOISE_print}
\index{NOISE sweep!print}

Running \Xyce{} NOISE analysis produces an output results file named
\verb|.cir.NOISE.prn|. Obtaining this file requires that the
\verb|.PRINT NOISE| line be specified. Using the \texttt{.PRINT} line,
\Xyce{} supports printing the total noise spectral density curves.
The output units for spectral densities are $V^2$/Hz and $A^2$/Hz.
Some examples are as follows:

\Example{\\ 
\texttt{.print noise inoise onoise} \\
\texttt{.print noise {log(inoise)} {log(onoise)}} \\
\texttt{.print noise inoise onoise V(4) VR(1)}  
}

\Xyce{} will also compute the total integrated output noise, and the
total integrated input noise for the specified output node.  This
information is sent to standard output, or to the user-specified log
file.  A typical output (which in this case was generated by the
netlist given in figure~\ref{noiseExample}) will look like this:

\Example{\\ 
\texttt{Total Output Noise = 1.28592e-09} \\
\texttt{Total Input Noise = 5.22876e-07} 
}

If \texttt{.STEP} is used with a noise analysis then the \Xyce{}
standard output will contain the values of the stepped parameters,
along with the values for the total integrated output noise and the
total integrated input noise for the specified output node.

Nodal voltages may be requested with a \verb|.PRINT NOISE| line, and
the values are the AC solution for the circuit.  All of the voltage
operators in Table ~\ref{Print_Complex} are supported for this case.

The DC values of voltage sources (e.g., \texttt{V1}) that are changed
with a \verb|.STEP| line during a NOISE analysis can be printed out
via the following syntax. Alternately, if a \verb|.OP| line is
included in the netlist then the output from the \verb+-r+ command
line option will contain the DC Operating Point (DCOP) values for all
of the nodal voltages.  (Note: Without the \verb|.OP| line, only the
AC solution will be included in the \verb+-r+ output for a NOISE
analysis.)

\Example{\\ 
\texttt{.print noise V1:DCV0} \\ 
}


\subsection{Device Model Support}

Note that stationary noise is not supported in every \Xyce{} device.
A list of \Xyce{} devices, and which of them support stationary noise,
is given in the \Xyce{} Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{}.

The \texttt{DNI} and \texttt{DNO} operators can print out the individual
input and output noise contributions for each noise source within a device
via \verb|.PRINT NOISE| lines.  Figure ~\ref{DniDnoExample} provides an
example.

The \texttt{-noise\_names\_file} command line option can generate a listing
of the noise source names for each device in a netlist.  The output of that
command for the netlist given in figure ~\ref{DniDnoExample} is shown in
figure ~\ref{NoiseNamesFile}.  In this example, \texttt{DNI(M1)} would
output the input noise contribution for all noise sources in MOSFET M1, while
\texttt{DNI(Q1,FN)} would only output the input flicker-noise contribution
from MOSFET M1.

\section{Sensitivity Analysis}
\label{SENS_Analysis}
\label{sensitivity_Overview}

The \texttt{.SENS} \index{\texttt{.SENS}} command instructs \Xyce{} to
calculate the sensitivities of an output expression with respect to a
specified list of circuit parameters.  This capability works in either
steady-state (\texttt{.DC}) or transient (\texttt{.TRAN}).

\Format{\par \texttt{.SENS objfunc=\{<output expression(s)>\}
    param=<circuit parameter(s)> \newline .options SENSITIVITY
    [direct=<1 or 0>] [adjoint=<1 or 0>]}}

At least one objective function parameter, \texttt{objfunc}, is
required.  It is possible to specify a comma-separated list of
objective functions.  The list of circuit parameters must have at
least one entry as well.  If there is more than one, the parameters
are specified as a comma-separated list.  \Xyce{} will not assume any
particular parameter list.  Unlike the Spice version of
\texttt{.SENS}, \Xyce{} will not automatically compute the sensitivity
of every parameter; only the parameters the user requested.

\subsection{Steady-State (DC) sensitivities}

For DC analysis, \Xyce{} can compute a direct sensitivity, an adjoint
sensitivity, or both.  In general, adjoint sensitivities are much more
efficient when computing the derivatives with respect to really large
numbers of parameters, but a small number of objective functions.
Direct sensitivities are most efficient for small numbers of
parameters, but large numbers of objective functions.  \Xyce{} allows
the user to specify multiple objective functions, as well as multiple
parameters, so either scenario could apply.

An example of using \texttt{.SENS} on a DC problem is shown in the
following netlist:
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{centering}
    \shadowbox{
      \begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
        \begin{vquote}

.SENS objfunc=\{0.5*(V(B)-3.0)**2.0\} param=R1:R,R2:R
.options SENSITIVITY direct=1 adjoint=1 stdoutput=1\color{black}
.END
\end{vquote}
\end{minipage}
}
\caption[Steady-State Sensitivity Example Netlist]
{Steady-State Sensitivity Example Netlist \label{DC_Sensitivity_Netlist} }
\end{centering}
\end{figure}
The output to stdout, which was requested by setting \texttt{stdoutput=1}, for this example is:
\begin{verbatim}
Direct Sensitivities of objective function:{0.5*(V(B)-3.0)**2.0}
Name	        Value	  Sensitivity	   Normalized
R1:R	   1.0000e+01	   6.2500e-02	   6.2500e-03
R2:R	   1.0000e+01	  -6.2500e-02	  -6.2500e-03

Adjoint Sensitivities of objective function:{0.5*(V(B)-3.0)**2.0}
Name	        Value	  Sensitivity	   Normalized
R1:R	   1.0000e+01	   6.2500e-02	   6.2500e-03
R2:R	   1.0000e+01	  -6.2500e-02	  -6.2500e-03
\end{verbatim}
In the above example, both adjoint and direct sensitivities are
computed.  This is a linear problem, so it is easy to compare them to
the analytic solution.
%\clearpage
\subsection{Transient sensitivities}
Sensitivities can also be computed for transient analysis.  As with
steady-state (DC) analysis, both direct and adjoint sensitivities are
supported.

\subsubsection{Transient Direct Sensitivities}
Transient direct sensitivities are a good choice if the number of
parameters is modest.  Also, if the output of interest is a full
waveform sensitivity, they will usually outperform adjoint
sensitivities, as from the perspective of adjoint calculations, each
time point constitutes a separate objective function, requiring a
separate integration.

Set \texttt{direct=1 adjoint=0} to specify transient direct
simulations.  The transient direct forumulation in \Xyce{} is based on
the one described by Hocevar~\cite{Hocevar1985}.  An example netlist
for a transient sensitivity calculation is given in
figure~\ref{Tran_Sensitivity_Netlist}.  This is a simple linear
problem (RC decay), so it has an analytic solution.

The analytic sensitivity solution is given by the solid line and the computed numerical
sensitivity is given by the dashed line.  The results match very well in this case,
with the two lines right on top of each other.

\clearpage
\subsubsection{Transient Adjoint Sensitivities}
Transient adjoint sensitivities are a good choice for really large
numbers of parameters, and when the number of objective functions is
modest.  For transient calculations, each time point is considered a
separate objective function, so it is best to use adjoints when the
sensitivity of interest concerns only one or a handful of time points.

Set \texttt{direct=0 adjoint=1} to specify transient adjoint
simulations.  The transient adjoint forumulation in \Xyce{} has
similarities to the ones described by Liu~\cite{Liu2014} and
Meir~\cite{BLAST2012}.  An example netlist for a transient adjoint
sensitivity calculation is given in
figure~\ref{Tran_Adjoint_Sensitivity_Netlist}.  This is a simple
linear problem (RC driven by a sinewave), so it has an analytic
solution.

\end{figure}
Results for the transient adjoint example are given in 
figure~\ref{transientAdjointSensitivityResult}.  The
analytic sensitivity solution is given by the dashed line and the
computed numerical sensitivity is given by the solid line.  The
results match very well in this case, with the two lines right on top
of each other.

\paragraph{Guidance for running transient adjoint analysis}
Transient adjoint sensitivities need to perform a backward time integration, 
after the original transient forward problem has completed.    So, generally, 
when running a transient adjoint netlist, the user may notice a pause in the 
calculation at the very end.  This is normal.

It is also important to understand that if using a point objective, the 
transient adjoint algorithm will consider every time step to be a unique, 
separate objective, and will need to perform a backward integration for each one.  
So, it will usually be important to restrict this to a limited number of time 
steps, or ideally a single time point.

To perform the adjoint calculation on a range of times, this can be set using 
the \texttt{.OPTIONS SENSITIVITY} commands \texttt{ADJOINTBEGINTIME} and 
\texttt{ADJOINTFINALTIME}.  Each of these must be set equal to a floating point
number in units of seconds.  To perform the adjoint calculation on a discrete 
set of time points (or a single time point), this can be set using using the 
\texttt{.OPTIONS SENSITIVITY} command \texttt{ADJOINTTIMEPOINTS} followed by a 
comma-separated list of times in units of seconds.  An example netlist, which 
uses this capability is shown in figure~\ref{Tran_Adjoint_Sensitivity_Netlist2}.  
It is identical to the netlist shown in figure~\ref{Tran_Adjoint_Sensitivity_Netlist} 
except that this command has been added.

\subsection{AC Sensitivities}
Sensitivities can also be computed for small-signal AC analysis.  As
with steady-state (DC) and transient analysis, both direct and adjoint
sensitivities are supported.  An example netlist which exercises the
capability is shown in figure~\ref{AC_Sensitivity_Netlist}.

The netlist commands for AC sensitivities are very similar to those
for DC, but with some small exceptions.   

Objective functions can be set in two ways.  One is to 
specify outputs using \texttt{objvars}
followed by a list of node names.    The other is to use the expression library, using the \texttt{acobjfunc} parameter.
The sensitivities that are computed
will be for the voltages at the listed nodes, or for the listed objective functions, with respect to the list
of sensitivity parameters.  It is currently not  possible to specify both types of objectives in the same netlist.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

For each specified output, there are four separate objective functions

polar representation, as well as real and imaginary for the cartesian
representation of the solution.  The console output for the example
netlist, for the first frequency, is shown in figure
~\ref{AC_Sensitivity_Result}.

\subsection{Output}
\label{SENS_Output}\index{\texttt{.PRINT}!\texttt{.SENS}}
For a full list and explanation of options related to \texttt{.SENS}
output see the \Xyce{} Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{}.

Sensitivity output can be sent to standard output, or to a
user-specified log file.  The format for this output is similar to
that generated by the circuit given in
figure~\ref{DC_Sensitivity_Netlist}.  This feature is mainly made
available in \Xyce{} so as to be similar to the sensitivity analysis
of older circuit simulators.  However, for most uses it isn't the most
practical output, so it is disabled by default.  To enable standard
output, one should set the following:
\begin{verbatim}
.options SENSITIVITY STDOUTPUT=1
\end{verbatim}

In addition to the screen output, \Xyce{} can also produce a plottable
file containing all the requested sensitivities.  This file can be
requested by adding either a \texttt{.PRINT SENS} or a \texttt{.PRINT
  TRANADJOINT} command to the input file.  Steady-state sensitivities
(adjoint or direct) and transient direct sensitivities will be handled
by the \texttt{.PRINT SENS} command.  Transient adjoint, on the other
hand, is handled by the \texttt{.PRINT TRANADJOINT} command.

Unlike the traditional \texttt{.PRINT} line, both \texttt{.PRINT SENS}
and \texttt{.PRINT TRANADJOINT} will assume that the user wants all
the sensitivities specified on the \texttt{.SENS} line.  As such it is
not necessary (or possible) to specify specific sensitivities on the
\texttt{.PRINT SENS} line.  If the line exists, that is sufficient to
produce the file, and it will contain a column for every objective
function and every derivative.  The file name is the same as the one
produced with \texttt{.PRINT}, but with ``\texttt{.SENS}'' included
just before the suffix.  Similarly, for transient adjoint, the output
file name has the string ``\texttt{.TRADJ}'' included before the
suffix.  Note also, that most of the same output formats
(\texttt{std}, \texttt{tecplot}, etc.)  are available for
\texttt{.PRINT SENS} and\texttt{.PRINT TRANADJOINT} as they are for
conventional \texttt{.PRINT}.  The available formats are listed in
table~\ref{SENS_Output_table},~\ref{SENS_AC_Output_table}and~\ref{TRANADJOINT_Output_table}.

As noted, transient adjoints are specified separately from
\texttt{.PRINT SENS}.  This is because the transient adjoint
calculation is performed as a post-process, after the original forward
calculation has been completed, and \Xyce{}'s forward outputters are
no longer active.  To specify transient adjoint output, one must use
\texttt{.PRINT TRANADJOINT} instead.  As it is possible to perform
both a transient direct and a transient adjoint calculation as part of
the same computation, and most of \Xyce{}'s output files are in column
format, there wasn't an easy way to have them use the same outputter.

\subsection{Notes about .SENS accuracy and formulation}
The sensitivity calculation in \Xyce{} is based on a chain rule
calculation.  Ultimately, the calculation will produce $dO/dp$, where
$O$ is a user-specified objective function, and $p$ is a
user-specified parameter.  $dO/dp$ is equal to:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dO}{dp} = \frac{\partial O}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial p} + \frac{\partial O}{\partial p}
  \label{objectiveDerivative}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $x$ is a solution vector and $\partial x/\partial p$
is the sensitivity of that solution vector with respect to the
parameter.  Evaluating~\ref{objectiveDerivative} requires that
$\partial x/\partial p$ be computed first.  The direct sensivity
calculation for $\partial x/\partial p$ can be derived by considering
the DAE form of the residual equation:
\begin{equation}
  F(x,t) = \dot{q}(x,t) + j(x,t) - b(t) = 0
  \label{residual}
\end{equation}
\noindent In this equation, $q$ represents quantities that must be
differentiated with respect to time (such as capacitor charge), and
$j$ represents algebraic terms that depend on the solution $x$ (such
as DC currents), and $b$ are independent sources that only depend on
time.  Equation~\ref{residual} is solved to obtain the solution, $x$.
To obtain sensitivities, one must differentiate this equation with
respect to a parameter, $p$.
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dF}{dp} = \frac{d}{dp}\left( \dot{q} + j - b \right) = 0
  \label{dfdp}
\end{equation}
In steady-state, equation~\ref{dfdp} simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dF}{dp} = \frac{dj}{dp} - \frac{db}{dp} = 0
  \label{steady_dfdp}
\end{equation}
\noindent As $j$ is dependent upon $x$, the $\frac{dj}{dp}$ term must
be expanded via chain rule, and the resulting equation must be
re-arranged to set up a matrix equation that can be solved to obtain
$\frac{dx}{dp}$:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dj}{dx}\frac{dx}{dp} = - \frac{dj}{dp} + \frac{db}{dp} 
  \label{finalSens}
\end{equation}
\noindent In equation~\ref{finalSens}, the terms on the right hand
side are computed by the individual device models once the Newton loop
the circuit analysis has converged.  The Jacobian matrix on the left
hand side ($dj/dx$) is the same matrix used by the original analysis.
Once the linear system is solved, then $dx/dp$ is available for the
given parameter, and it can then be applied to
equation~\ref{objectiveDerivative}.  For transient, a similar linear
system is solved, which depends on the specific time integration
method used.  For Backward-Euler the linear system is:
\begin{equation}
  \left[ \frac{1}{h} \frac{dq}{dx} 
  + \frac{dj}{dx} \right] \frac{dx}{dp}_{n+1} 
 =
  -\frac{1}{h} \left[ \frac{dq}{dp}_{n+1} - \frac{dq}{dp}_n \right] 
 - \frac{dj}{dp} 
 + \frac{db}{dp} 
 + \frac{1}{h} \left[ \frac{dq}{dx} \right] \frac{dx}{dp}_n 
 \label{finalTransientSens}
\end{equation}
\noindent Where $h$ is the time step size.  As with ~\ref{finalSens},
the left hand side of the equation contains the original Jacobian
matrix.

In general, the accuracy of the above calculation is dependent on the
accuracy of the individual derivatives that comprise
equations~\ref{objectiveDerivative} and~\ref{finalSens}
or~\ref{finalTransientSens}.  In \Xyce{}, the Jacobian derivatives
($dj/dx$ and $dq/dx$) are always analytic.  Similarly, the objective
function derivatives ($dO/dx$) are also always analytic.  However, the
derivatives on the right hand side of~\ref{finalTransientSens}
($dj/dp$, $db/dp$ and $dq/dp$) depend on particular device
implementations.  If the device was implemented with analytic
parameter sensitivies, then those sensitivities are used.  If analytic
derivatives were not available, then the $dj/dp$, $dq/dp$ and $db/dp$
derivatives are computed using finite differences.  A list of \Xyce{}
devices, and which of them support analytic sensitivities, is given in
the \Xyce{} Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{}.

For some problems, finite difference derivatives will work fine, but
some devices and/or circuit problems have wide ranges of solution
and/or parameter scalings, and this can render inaccurate finite
difference derivatives.  As this capability develops, most devices
should eventually provide analytic derivatives.

The above derivation and arguments were given for direct sensitivities
(as that is the only form supported for both DC and transient), but
the same ideas with regard to accuracy apply for adjoint sensitivites.

For transient, note that the transient direct calculation uses the
same time steps that are used for the original circuit analysis.  It
does not impose any additional error control that is specific to the
accuracy of $dx/dp$.

\section{S-parameter Analysis}
\label{SP_Analysis}
\label{SP_Sweep_Overview}
\index{analysis!S-parameter} \index{S-parameter analysis} \index{\texttt{.LIN}}
\index{AC sweep} \index{analysis!AC sweep}

The S-parameter small-signal analysis of \Xyce{} computes linear
transfer parameters as a function of frequency for a general
multi-port network. The program first computes the DC operating point
of the circuit and then linearizes the circuit. The resultant linear
circuit is then analyzed over a user-specified range of
frequencies. The output of a S-parameter analysis is multi-port
scattering (S) parameters. The S-parameters represent the ratio of
incident and scattered normalized voltage waves.  The analysis results
can also be output as Y-parameter or Z-parameter values.

\subsection{.LIN Statement}

One may specify S-parameter analyses by using a \verb|.LIN| command with a \verb|.AC| command in the netlist.
Here is an example of typical \verb|.AC| and \verb|.LIN| lines:

\Example{\\
\texttt{.AC DEC 10 1K 100MEG}  \\
\texttt{.LIN sparcalc=1 format=touchstone}  \\
}

The \verb|.LIN| analysis is similar to a basic small signal \verb|.AC|
analysis, but it also calculates small signal transfer parameters
between terminals identified using port (P) devices. The \Xyce{}
Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{} provides a complete description of
\verb|.LIN| analysis and the P device.  To output Y-parameter or
Z-parameter values instead the \texttt{LINTYPE=Y} or
\texttt{LINTYPE=Z} argument can be used on the \texttt{.LIN} line.

\subsection{Port Devices}
\label{SP_Port}
\index{S-parameter analysis!port}

The \verb|.LIN| analysis computes the S-parameters based on the
location of the port (P) devices and the values of their reference
impedances. The port devices identify the ports used in \verb|.LIN|
analysis. The \Xyce{} Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{} provides a
complete description of the port devices. Some examples are as
follows:

\Example{\\   
%\texttt{*name nodelist type value  phase(deg)}  \\
\texttt{P1 1 0 port = 1} \\
\texttt{P2 12 0  port= 2  z0=100 }
}

NOTE: Each port requires a unique port number. If a circuit has N
ports, the netlist must contain the sequential set of port numbers, 1
to N.

\subsection{Example}
An example S-parameter analysis netlist is given in
figure~\ref{spExample}.  This example uses 2 ports.  The S parameters
are output to a file in Touchstone 1 format
\cite{touchstone2_std_2009}.  Touchstone 2 format is also supported.
Note that \texttt{SPARCALC=1} is specified on the \texttt{.LIN} line.
If \texttt{SPARCALC=0} is specified instead then a \texttt{.AC}
analysis will be done.

\subsection{Output}
\label{LIN_Output}
For S-parameter analysis, the output is controlled by the \texttt{.LIN}
command when \texttt{SPARCALC=1} on that line.  Any information on
\texttt{.PRINT AC} lines will be ignored in that case.
Table~\ref{LIN_Output_table} lists the format options and files created.
If \texttt{SPARCALC=0} then a \texttt{.AC} analysis is done instead.

All three data formats defined in the Touchstone standard, which are
real-imaginary (RI), magnitude-angle(MA) and magnitude(db)-angle (DB),
are supported.  The default is RI.  Other options can be selected via
the inclusion of the \texttt{DATAFORMAT=<val>} argument on the
\texttt{.LIN} line. Per the Touchstone standard, all angle values are
output in degrees.

The default filename for both Touchstone formats is
\texttt{<netlistName>.sNp} where N is the number of ``ports''
(\texttt{P} devices) specified in the netlist.  The output can be
redirected to another file with the \texttt{-o} command line option or
by using a \texttt{FILE=<filename>} argument on the \texttt{.LIN}
line.

The default output is S-parameters.  The \texttt{LINTYPE=<S|Y|Z>}
argument can be used on the \texttt{.LIN} line to select Y-parameter
or Z-parameter output instead.  (Note: The default filename is still
\texttt{<netlistName>.sNp} even if the output file contains
Y-parameter or Z-parameter output rather than S-parameter output.)
The \Xyce{} Reference Guide\ReferenceGuide{} has a complete listing of
which arguments, typically used on a \texttt{.PRINT} line also work on
a \texttt{.LIN} line.

\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

When a \texttt{.LIN} analysis is done then additional output variable
formats are available via the \texttt{.PRINT AC} line, where
\texttt{<index1>} and \texttt{<index2>} must both be greater than 0
and also both less than or equal to the number of ports in the
netlist:
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item \texttt{SR(<index1>,<index2>)} to output the real component of an S-parameter
\item \texttt{SI(<index1>,<index2>)} to output the imaginary component of an S-parameter
\item \texttt{SM(<index1>,<index2>)} to output the magnitude of an S-parameter
\item \texttt{SP(<index1>,<index2>)} to output the phase of an S-parameter in degrees
\item \texttt{SDB(<index1>,<index2>)} to output the magnitude of an S-parameter in decibels.
\item \texttt{YR(<index1>,<index2>)} to output the real component of a Y-parameter
\item \texttt{YI(<index1>,<index2>)} to output the imaginary component of a Y-parameter
\item \texttt{YM(<index1>,<index2>)} to output the magnitude of a Y-parameter
\item \texttt{YP(<index1>,<index2>)} to output the phase of a Y-parameter in degrees
\item \texttt{YDB(<index1>,<index2>)} to output the magnitude of a Y-parameter in decibels.
\item \texttt{ZR(<index1>,<index2>)} to output the real component of a Z-parameter
\item \texttt{ZI(<index1>,<index2>)} to output the imaginary component of a Z-parameter
\item \texttt{ZM(<index1>,<index2>)} to output the magnitude of a Z-parameter
\item \texttt{ZP(<index1>,<index2>)} to output the phase of a Z-parameter in degrees
\item \texttt{ZDB(<index1>,<index2>)} to output the magnitude of a Z-parameter in decibels.
