\section{Random Sampling Analysis}
\label{SAMPLING_Analysis}
\label{sampling_Overview}

\index{\texttt{.EMBEDDEDSAMPLING}}

\Xyce{} supports two different styles of random sampling analysis.  One is specified 
with the \verb|.SAMPLING| 
command, and the other is specified with the \verb|.EMBEDDEDSAMPLING| commmand.

The \verb|.SAMPLING| command causes \Xyce{} to execute the primary analysis (\verb|.DC|,
\verb|.AC|, \verb|.TRAN|, etc.) inside a loop over randomly distributed parameters.  
The user specifies a list of random parameters, their distributions, distribution 
parameters (such as mean and standard deviation), and the total number of 
sample points.  The primary analysis is then executed sequentially for each sample point.
The \verb|.SAMPLING| capability uses a lot of the same code base as \verb|.STEP|, 
so most of the guidance for \verb|.STEP|, including legal parameters, output 
file formats, supported analyses types, etc., also applies to \verb|.SAMPLING|.

The \verb|.EMBEDDEDSAMPLING| command also causes \Xyce{} to create a loop over 
randomly distributed parameters, but unlike \verb|.SAMPLING|, this loop is 
implemented inside the solver loop rather than outside of it.  As such, it 
creates a block linear system, in which each matrix block has the structure 
of the original matrix, and the number of blocks is equal to the number of sample points.
As such, all the parameters are propagated simultaneously, rather than sequentially.
Unlike \verb|.SAMPLING|, which can be applied to all types of \Xyce{} analysis, 
\verb|.EMBEDDEDSAMPLING| can only be applied to \verb|.DC| and \verb|.TRAN|.

Both types of sampling methods can be applied to a variety of inputs and outputs.
For inputs,
\Xyce{}  can use \verb|.SAMPLING| or \verb|.EMBEDDEDSAMPLING| to modify 
any device instance or device
model parameter, as well as the circuit temperature.  It can also be used 
to sweep over any user-defined parameter (either \texttt{.GLOBAL\_PARAM} 
or \texttt{.PARAM} ), as long as that parameter is  defined in the 
global scope.

For outputs, both \verb|.SAMPLING| and \verb|.EMBEDDEDSAMPLING| 
can apply statistical analysis (computing moments such as mean and standard deviation) 
to most outputs that appear on the \verb|.PRINT| line.
However, the two analysis types have some differences.    \verb|.SAMPLING| will only 
apply statistical analysis at the end of the calculation, while \verb|.EMBEDDEDSAMPLING| 
can apply statistical analysis at each time step.  Relatedly, 
\verb|.SAMPLING| can also be applied to any \verb|.MEASURE|, but 
\verb|.EMBEDDEDSAMPLING| lacks this capability. 

\subsection{.SAMPLING and .EMBEDDEDSAMPLING Statements}
\label{sampling_statement}
Sampling analysis may be specified by simply adding a \verb|.SAMPLING| 
or a \verb|.EMBEDDEDSAMPLING| line to a netlist.    The format for the two commands is nearly 
identical.

Sampling analysis such as \verb|.SAMPLING| or \verb|.EMBEDDEDSAMPLING| is not considered a ``primary'' analysis type.
This means that such a command by itself is not an 
adequate analysis specification, as it merely specifies an additional parametric loop to augment the
primary analysis.  A standard analysis line, specifying \verb|.TRAN|, \verb|.AC|, \verb|.HB|, 
and \verb|.DC| analysis, is still required.

Examples of typical \verb|.SAMPLING| lines:

\Example{\\
\texttt{\\
.SAMPLING  \\
+ param=M1:L, M1:W \\
+ type=uniform,uniform \\
+ lower\_bounds=5u,5u \\
+ upper\_bounds=7u,7u \\
}
\texttt{ \\
.SAMPLING \\
+ param=R1,c1 \\
+ type=normal,normal \\
+ means=3K,1uF \\
+ std\_deviations=1K,0.2uF \\
}

}

In the first example, \verb|M1:L| and \verb|M1:W| 
are the names of the
parameters (in this instance, the length and width parameters of the MOSFET
\texttt{M1}), \verb|5u| is the minimum value of both parameters and
\verb|7u| is the maximum value of both parameters.  For both parameters, 
the distribution (specified by \texttt{type}) is uniform.
In the second example, the two parameters are \verb|R1| and \verb|c1|.   In this 
case, it isn't necessary to specify the specific parameter of \verb|R1| or \verb|c1| 
as resistors and capacitors have simple default parameters (see section~\ref{sampling_SpecialCases}).  
The distributions of both parameters are normal, and the means and standard deviations 
are specified for both in comma-separated lists.

For any list of parameters, all the required fields must be provided in comma-separated 
lists.  \Xyce{} will throw an error if the length of any of the lists is different 
than that of the parameter list.

\subsection{.options SAMPLES and EMBEDDEDSAMPLES Statements}
\label{options_samples_statement}

To specify the number of samples, use the netlist command \texttt{.options 
SAMPLES numsamples=<value>}.   For sampling analysis to work correctly, this parameter is required.
Other sampling details, including the sampling type, the covariance matrix, 
the statistical outputs and the random seed can be specified using the 
same \verb|.options SAMPLES| netlist command.  Some examples of this command are:

\Example{\\
\texttt{ \\
.options samples numsamples=1000 \\
}
\texttt{ \\
.options samples numsamples=30 \\
+ covmatrix=1e6,1.0e-3,1.0e-3,4e-14 \\
+ OUTPUTS={R1:R},{C1:C} \\
+ MEASURES=maxSine \\
+ SAMPLE\_TYPE=LHS \\
+ SEED=743190581 \\
}
}
The random seed can be set either in the \texttt{.options SAMPLES} statement, or 
it can be set from the command line using the \texttt{-randseed} option.  If it 
is not set either way, then the random seed is generated internally.

In the example there are two different types of outputs specified.  One is using 
the keyword \texttt{OUTPUTS}, and this is used to specify a comma-separated list 
of outputs corresponding to typical \texttt{.PRINT} line outputs.  Solution 
variables, user defined parameters, and expressions depending on both are typical.  

The other type of output is specified using the keyword \texttt{MEASURES}, and 
this is used to specify a comma-separated list of netlist \texttt{.MEASURE} commands.
This type of output is only available to \texttt{.SAMPLING} and not to \texttt{.EMBEDDEDSAMPLING}.

\subsection{Sampling a Device Instance Parameter}
\label{sampling_InstanceParam}
Figure~\ref{Sampling_Netlist_1} provides a simple application of \verb|.SAMPLING| 
to a device instance parameter.  The circuit is a simple voltage divider driven 
by a oscillating voltage source.  The randomly sampled parameter is the resistance 
of \texttt{R1}, which is given a normal distribution with a specified mean and 
standard deviation.

As the circuit is executed multiple times, an output file is generated based on 
the \verb|.PRINT| command.  The \verb|.PRINT| statement is still used in the same 
way that it would be in a non-sampling analysis.  However, the output file 
contains the concatenated output of each \verb|.SAMPLING| step.  
Section~\ref{sampling_output_files} provides more details of how \texttt{.SAMPLING} 
changes \texttt{.PRINT} output files.

\Xyce{} computes statistical outputs for quantities specified by \texttt{OUTPUTS} 
and \texttt{MEASURES} on the \texttt{.options SAMPLES} line.  For these outputs,
moments such as mean and variance are computed and sent to standard output.  More 
details of this type of output, as well as examples, are given in section~\ref{statistical_outputs}.

\subsection{Sampling a Device Model Parameter}
\label{sampling_ModelParam}

Sampling a model parameter can be done in an identical manner to an instance parameter.  
Figure~\ref{Sampling_Netlist_2} provides a simple application of \verb|.SAMPLING| to a 
device model and a device instance.  This is the same diode clipper circuit as was used 
in the Transient Analysis section (see section \ref{Transient_Analysis_Sec}), except that 
several lines of sampling commands (in red) have been added.  

The sampling commands will cause \Xyce{} to sample the model parameter, \verb|D1N3940:IS| as well as the 
resistance of the resistor, R4. Both of the parameters are randomly sampled using uniform distributions 
with specified lower and upper bounds.

\subsection{Sampling a User-Defined Parameter}
\label{sampling_GlobalParam}

Sampling can be applied to user-defined parameters, as long as they are declared in the top level netlist (global scope).  
It cannot be applied to user-defined parameters which are defined in a subcircuit.  An example of such usage, with a global parameter, is given 
in figure~\ref{Sampling_Netlist_3}. This circuit identical to the circuit in 
figure~\ref{Sampling_Netlist_1}, except that it uses global parameters.  
If the global parameters in this netlist are changed to normal parameters (\texttt{.PARAM}), this circuit will also work.

\label{Sampling_Netlist_3}}
\end{centering}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sampling over Temperature}
\label{sampling_Temperature}

It is also possible to sample temperature.  To do so, simply 
specify \verb|temp| as the parameter name.  It will work in the 
same manner as \verb|.SAMPLING| when applied to model and instance 
parameters.

\subsection{Special cases: Sampling Independent Sources, Resistors, Capacitors and Inductors}
\label{sampling_SpecialCases}

For some devices, there is generally only one parameter that one would
want to sample.  For example, a linear resistor's only parameter of
interest is resistance, R.  Similarly, for a DC voltage or current
source, one is usually only interested in the magnitude of the source, DCV0.
Finally, linear capacitors generally only have capacitance, C, as a 
parameter of interest, while inductors generally only have inductance, L,
as a parameter of interest.  

For these simple devices, it is not necessary to specify both the
parameter and device on the \texttt{.SAMPLING} line: only the device name
is strictly required, as these devices have default
parameters that are assumed if no parameter name is given explicitly.

Examples of usage are given below.  The first two lines are equivalent
--- in the first line, the resistance parameter of \texttt{R4} is
named explicitly, and in the second line the resistance parameter is
implicit. A similar example is then shown for the DC voltage of the 
voltage source \texttt{VCC}.  In the remaining lines, parameter names are all 
implicit, and the default parameters of the associated devices are used.

\Example{ \\
          \fontsize{10pt}{11pt}
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
  \texttt{.SAMPLING param=R4:R,C1:C} &\texttt{type=normal,normal}  &\texttt{means=3k,1u}  &\texttt{std\_deviations=1k,0.1u} \\ 
  \texttt{.SAMPLING param=R4,C1} &\texttt{type=normal,normal}  &\texttt{means=3k,1u}  &\texttt{std\_deviations=1k,0.1u} \\ 
  \texttt{.SAMPLING VCC:DCV0}&\texttt{type=uniform}  &\texttt{means=6.0}  &\texttt{std\_deviations=1.0 } \\  
  \texttt{.SAMPLING VCC}&\texttt{type=uniform}  &\texttt{means=6.0}  &\texttt{std\_deviations=1.0 } \\ 
  \texttt{.SAMPLING param=C1} &\texttt{type=normal}  &\texttt{means=0.5u}  &\texttt{std\_deviations=0.05u} \\ 
  \texttt{.SAMPLING param=L1} &\texttt{type=normal}  &\texttt{means=0.5m}  &\texttt{std\_deviations=0.01m} \\ 
\end{tabular}
        }

Independent sources require further explanation.  Their default
parameter, DCV0, only applies to \texttt{.DC} analyses.  They do not have
default parameters for their transient forms, such as \texttt{SIN}
or \texttt{PULSE}.

\subsection{Sampling using random operators from expressions}

The \Xyce{} expression library supports random operators in expressions, 
including \texttt{AGAUSS}, \texttt{GAUSS}, \texttt{AUNIF}, \texttt{UNIF} and \texttt{RAND}.
\Xyce{} \texttt{.SAMPLING} and \texttt{.EMBEDDEDSAMPLING} analyses are able to use these, but they are not
connected by default.  In order to use random expression operators with \texttt{.SAMPLING}, 
the following commend must be present in the netlist:

\Example{\\
\texttt{\\
.SAMPLING  useExpr=true
}
}

This capability is potentially very powerful, as the random operators can 
act as operators within complex expressions.  A simple example of this feature can be 
seen in figure~\ref{Sampling_Netlist_4}.

Note that currently, this feature cannot be used in the same netlist as the 
specification described in section~\ref{sampling_statement}.  If 
\texttt{useExpr=true}, \Xyce{} will ignore the comma-separated lists such as 
\texttt{param}.  Likewise, if \texttt{useExpr=false} (the default), then 
\Xyce{} will not randomly sample any random operators present in the circuit.  
It will only sample the parameters listed by comma-separated lists.

\end{figure}



\subsection{Output files}
\label{sampling_output_files}
\index{output!\texttt{.SAMPLING}}

Users can think of \texttt{.SAMPLING} simulations as a large number of distinct executions
of the same circuit netlist.  The output data, as specified by a \texttt{.PRINT}
line, however, goes to a single output file.  
\Xyce{} also creates a second auxilliary file with the \texttt{*.res} 
suffix, which just contains the parameter values.  Statistical outputs 
can also be produced (see section~\ref{statistical_outputs}).

Figure~\ref{Sampling_Netlist_1} shows an example file named \verb+clip.cir+, which when run will produce files
\verb+clip.cir.res+ and \verb+clip.cir.prn+.  The file \verb+clip.cir.res+
contains one line for each step, showing what parameter value was used
on that step.  \verb+clip.cir.prn+ is the familiar output format, but
the \verb+INDEX+ field recycles to zero each time a new step begins.
As the default behavior distinguishes each step's output only by recycling 
the \verb+INDEX+ field to zero, it can be beneficial to add the sampling
parameters to the \verb+.PRINT+ line.   For the default file format 
(\texttt{format=std}), \Xyce{} will not automatically include these sampling parameters,
so for plotting it is usually best to specify them by hand.

If using the default \texttt{.prn} file format (\texttt{format=std}), the 
resulting \texttt{.SAMPLING} simulation output file will be a simple concatenation of
each step's underlying analysis output.
If using \texttt{format=probe}, the data for each execution of the circuit
will be in distinct sections of the file, and it should be easy to 
plot the results using PROBE.  If using \texttt{format=tecplot}, 
the results of each \texttt{.SAMPLING} simulation will be in a distinct
Tecplot zone. Finally, format=raw will place the results for each \texttt{.SAMPLING} 
simulation in a distinct ``plot'' region. 

Note that for sampling calculations involving a really large number of sample 
points, the single output file can become prohibitively large.  Be careful when 
using \verb|.PRINT| if the number of samples is large.   If the number is really 
large (thousands) consider excluding any \verb|.PRINT| output statements and 
just rely on statistical outputs, described next in section~\ref{statistical_outputs}.
Similarly, the generation of the measure output can be suppressed with 
\texttt{.OPTIONS MEASURE MEASPRINT}.

\subsection{Statistical Outputs}
\label{statistical_outputs}
When performing uncertainty quantification analysis, the outputs of interest are 
often statistical moments of different circuit metrics.   \Xyce{} will compute these at the
end of a sampling calculation upon request.  The requested statistical outputs are 
specified on the \texttt{.options SAMPLING} line in the netlist.  For an example 
see the \texttt{OUTPUTS} and \texttt{MEASURES} fields in section~\ref{options_samples_statement}.  
Both \texttt{OUTPUTS} and \texttt{MEASURES} are specified as comma-separated 
lists.  The list of \texttt{OUTPUTS} must contain valid expressions that can be 
processed by the \Xyce{} expression library.  The list of \texttt{MEASURES} must 
consist valid \texttt{.MEASURE} statement names, which are present elsewhere in 
the netlist.

The example netlist given by figure~\ref{Sampling_Netlist_1} will produce the result 
given by figure~\ref{Sampling_Netlist_1_output}.  The example netlist given 
by figure~\ref{Sampling_Netlist_2} will produce the result given by 
figure~\ref{Sampling_Netlist_2_output}.  In both examples, the number of samples 
is relatively small, so the exact quantities computed will vary somewhat from run to run.
