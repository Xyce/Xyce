\begin{abstract}

This manual describes the use of the \Xyce{} Parallel Electronic
Simulator.  \Xyce{} has been designed as a SPICE-compatible, 
high-performance analog circuit simulator, and has 
been written to support the simulation needs of the Sandia National
Laboratories electrical designers.  This development has 
focused on improving capability over the current
state-of-the-art in the following areas:

\begin{XyceItemize}

\item Capability to solve extremely large circuit problems by supporting
  large-scale parallel computing platforms (up to thousands of processors).
  This includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.
\item A differential-algebraic-equation (DAE) formulation, which better isolates the 
  device model package from solver algorithms. This allows one to develop new types of
  analysis without requiring the implementation of analysis-specific device models.
\item Device models that are specifically tailored to meet Sandia's needs,
  including some radiation-aware devices (for Sandia users only).
\item Object-oriented code design and implementation using modern
  coding practices.

\end{XyceItemize}

\Xyce{} is a parallel code in the most general sense of the phrase --- a message
passing parallel implementation --- which allows it to run efficiently a
wide range of computing platforms.  These include serial,
shared-memory and distributed-memory parallel platforms.  
Attention has been paid to the specific nature
of circuit-simulation problems to ensure that optimal parallel efficiency is
achieved as the number of processors grows.
