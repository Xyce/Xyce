The behavior of the \texttt{PULSE} transient source has changed & The \texttt{V1}
parameter, which is the initial value, is now a required parameter.  Previously,
a \texttt{PULSE} source that was specified with no parameters would default to a 0V 
(or 0A) DC source.  Note that in other simulators, like PSpice and ngspice, both the 
\texttt{V1} and \texttt{V2} parameters may be required for a \texttt{PULSE} source.
\\ \hline
The behavior of \texttt{TIME}, \texttt{TEMP} and \texttt{VT} on
\texttt{.PARAM} lines has changed & That usage is now a parsing error.
