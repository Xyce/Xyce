\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The BSIM-CMG version 110 (level 110 MOSFET) now provides its
  drain-source conductance (\texttt{GM}), junction voltages
  (\texttt{Vds}, \texttt{Vbs}, and \texttt{Vgs}), drain-source
  saturation voltage (\texttt{Vdsat}), and threshold voltage
  (\texttt{Vth}) for output on \texttt{.PRINT} lines using the ``N()''
  syntax.
\item The VBIC version 1.2 (BJT level 10) has been removed in this
  release of \Xyce{}.  Users of VBIC must use the VBIC 1.3 3T
  device instead. See the \Xyce{} Reference Guide Q device (BJT)
  section for details on how legacy VBIC 1.2 netlists may be converted
  to use VBIC 1.3 instead.
\item The unoptimized versions of VBIC 1.3 3-terminal and BSIM-CMG 110
  (level 111 BJT and level 1110 MOSFET) have been removed.  Only the
  optimized versions of these devices (level 11 BJT and level 110
  MOSFET) remain in Xyce 6.11.
\item A new ``charge expression'' variant of the capacitor has been
  implemented.  Users may specify a solution-dependent expression for
  the capacitor's ``Q'' parameter, and this expression will be used to
  evaluate the capacitor's charge instead of by computing it from the
  capacitance.
\item Several of the devices that had been generated from Verilog-A
  sources have been regenerated in such a manner as to realize a
  significant performance improvement over the versions in \Xyce{} 6.10.
  The models that have been regenerated for this release are:
  \begin{XyceItemize}
  \item VBIC 1.3 4-terminal  (BJT level 12)
  \item HICUM levels 0 and 2 (BJT levels 230 and 234)
  \item PSP version 102 and 103 (MOSFET levels 102 and 103)
  \item JUNCAP 200 (Diode level 200)
  \item MEXTRAM (BJT level 504)
  \item MVS 2.0.0 (MOSFET levels 2000 (ETSOI) and 2001 (HEMT))
  \end{XyceItemize}
  Performance improvements of up to a factor of four in the evaluation
  of model equations have been observed in these devices as a result of this
  change.

  Furthermore, the VBIC 1.3 3-terminal model, which had previously had
  its derivatives optimized by hand in \Xyce{} 6.10 (with a resulting
  performance improvement of approximately a factor of five) has been
  regenerated in this manner, which has realized a further improvement
  in device evaluation of approximately 25\% over \Xyce{} 6.10.
\item A bug was found in the HEMT version of MVS 2.0.0 (level 2001
  MOSFET) as it was obtained from its authors.  The bug has been fixed
  in this release, but does change the results of simulation slightly.
\item A new pattern (PAT) source function was added for the V
  and I devices.
\item An error in the SPICE-compatible level 1 and level 2 diode model
  that could result in convergence problems or incorrect results at
  high temperatures was corrected.  See the ``Fixed Defects'' table
  under the heading for bug 1144-SON for details.
\item The BSIM3 device now supports analytic parameter sensitivities.
\item Device-level parameter finite-difference sensitivities are now much more efficient for transient adjoints.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The time step recovery algorithm is now considered deprecated.  It will be removed in a future version of \Xyce{}.

\item The S-parameter analysis is now supported in Xyce. It can be enabled by using a \verb|.LIN| command with a \verb|.AC| command in the netlist. The port device was developed to support S-parameter analysis and it can be used for DC, AC and transient analyses.The results of S-parameter analysis can be output to a file in either Touchstone 1 or Touchstone 2 format. See the \Xyce{} Users' and Reference Guides
for more details.

\item The initial guess method based on DC op solutions for HB is now supported and it can be enabled by using the TAHB option.

\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The \Xyce{} expression library now accepts C-style ternary
  conditional operators.  Please see section 2.2 of the \Xyce{} Reference Guide
  for important information about restrictions on this operator and
  details about its behavior.
\item Expressions may now contain curly braces in most contexts.  They
  are treated as identical to parentheses.
\item ``X'' is a now an allowed scaling factor for 1e6.  In prior \Xyce{}
  releases, only ``MEG'' was recognized as a scaling factor for 1e6.
\item The \texttt{-remeasure} command line option now supports the use 
of the I() operator in the re-measured output files.
\item .MEASURE is now supported for .AC analyses.
\item Improved support for expressions on .MEASURE lines.  See the ``Expression
Support'' subsection of the .MEASURE section of the \Xyce{} Reference Guide 
for more details.
\item For improved HSPICE compatibility, the MEASFAIL, MEASDGT and MEASOUT
options are now supported for .OPTIONS MEASURE.
\item Improved support for ``arithmetic operators'' (e.g., + - or *) in node names
and device names that are used in expressions. See the ``Legal Characters in Node
and Device Names'' subsection of the \Xyce{} Reference Guide for more details.
\item Transient direct sensitivities can now be processed using \texttt{.FOUR}.
\item Parameter sensitivities are now supported for \texttt{.AC} analysis.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Important Announcements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The model interpolation technique described in the \Xyce{}
  Reference Guide in section 2.1.17 has been marked as deprecated, and
  will be removed in a future release of Xyce.
\item It has been determined that some distributions of Linux have
  broken builds of OpenMPI in their package repositories.  Building
  \Xyce{} from source code in parallel with these OpenMPI installs
  will result in a version of \Xyce{} that may crash on some problems.
  This is not a bug in \Xyce{}, but a packaging error of the OpenMPI
  package on those operating systems.  Please see commentary in the
  ``Known Defects'' section of these release notes under bug number
  ``967-SON''.
\item \Xyce{} has deprecated the default conversion of quoted-string file
  names to a table of x,y pairs of data.  The old convention of
  \texttt{PARAMETER="file.dat"} which worked in some model statements
  and in behavioral sources will now generate a warning in the \Xyce{}
  output.  The correct way to specify a file of data for a paramater
  is to use the new \texttt{tablefile} keyword as in
  \texttt{PARAMETER=tablefile("file.dat")}.  While this release of
  \Xyce{} will accept both the old and new syntax, future releases
  will only accept the syntax of
  \texttt{PARAMETER=tablefile("file.dat")}.  Also, a new
  syntax of \texttt{PARAMETER=string("string value")} has been
  introduced to specify parameters that are pure strings.  This will
  be deprecated a future release and the simpler syntax of
  \texttt{PARAMETER="string value"} will be used to specify string
  valued parameters.
\item The ``Xygra'' device, which was written as a special-purpose
  coupling mechanism to ALEGRA but which has occasionally been used
  for other coupling problems, has been marked as deprecated.  The
  new, more flexible ``General External'' device was created to take
  its place, and has supplanted the use of Xygra in ALEGRA.  The Xygra
  device and the API that enables it will be removed in \Xyce{} 6.12.
  If your code has been using the Xygra capability to couple to Xyce,
  you must replace your usage with the new capability.  The ``General
  External'' coupling mechanism is documented thoroughly in an
  application note available on the \Xyce{} web site.
