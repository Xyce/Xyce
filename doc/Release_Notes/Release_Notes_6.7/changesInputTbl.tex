Some of the default values for the instance parameters for the Power Grid
Devices have changed. &  Several of the instance parameters for the 
Power Grid devices were changed from 1 to 0, so those parameters could be 
omitted from the instance line if they were zero.  .STEP compatibility also 
necessitated a change in the allowed values for the Transformer Type.
The \Xyce{} Reference Guide has more details.
