\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

For up-to-date information not available at the time these notes were produced,

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
     \item The HICUM Level 0 BJT model version 1.32 was added as Xyce BJT level 230.
     \item The HICUM Level 2 BJT model version 2.34 was added as Xyce BJT level 234.
     \item A ``solution-dependent capacitor'', which allows the device
          capacitance to depend on solution variables such as node voltages,
          has been supported since \Xyce{} Version 5.1.2. It is now documented
          in the Reference Guide.
     \item THE VBIC 1.2 (Level=10) MODEL IS NOW DEPRECATED.  It will be removed
          in version 6.8 of \Xyce{}.  The VBIC 1.3 model (levels 11 and 12)
          will be the only supported VBIC model in version 6.8 of \Xyce{}.
          Please update any netlists you have that use the level=10 model to
          use one of these VBIC 1.3 models instead.
     \item The Multiplicity Factor (M) is now supported for the R, L and C devices.
     \item Power output is now supported for the component inductors in both
          linear and nonlinear mutual inductors (K device).
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
     \item HB analysis now uses the block Jacobi preconditioner with GMRES by
          default.  In previous releases, the default solver for HB was
          unpreconditioned GMRES.
     \item Transient adjoint sensitivity analysis now works with trapezoid
          integration.  Previously it only worked with gear.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
     \item A ``-randseed'' command line argument has been added to allow the
          user to specify a seed for the random number generator that is used
          for the expression library's ``rand,'' ``gauss,'' and ``agauss''
          functions.
     \item When any expression includes use of a random number function (``rand,''
          ``gauss,'' or ``agauss''), or if ``-randseed'' is given, Xyce will
          output the seed that is being used for that run.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Deployment Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
     \item \Xyce{} binary releases for Windows are now 64-bit executables.
          Binaries for all prior releases had been 32-bit executables.
     \item On Sandia HPC and CEE systems, both serial and parallel versions of
          \Xyce{} have been deployed with shared library plugin support built
          in, and ADMS has been installed and made accessible through the same
          module load that provides access to Xyce.  This enables \Xyce{} users
          of those systems to build their own models in Verilog-A and test them
          as plugins.  See the \Xyce{}/ADMS Users' Guide on the external Xyce
          web site for details on how to use this feature.
\end{XyceItemize}
