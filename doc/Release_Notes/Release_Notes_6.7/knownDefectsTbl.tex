\textbf{855-SON}: Missing error message when a netlist uses an operator (e.g., IR or P) that 
is not supported for .AC analyses &  This is related to SON Bug 718.  \Xyce{} will output
all zeroes or all NaNs, for the requested quantity, when a netlist uses an operator (e.g., 
\texttt{IR} or \texttt{P}) that is unsupported for .AC analyses.  Instead, \Xyce{} 
should report a netlist-parsing warning or error for this case.

\textbf{\textit{Workaround}}: There is none, other than noticing that an output waveform 
value is unexpectedly all zeroes or all NaNs. \\ \hline

\textbf{850-SON}: Segfault and improper error handling for improperly formated functions &
When a user-defined function is called with the wrong number of parameters, \Xyce{} is supposed to abort 
with an error message.  However, in some cases Xyce segfaults instead.  There are also 
cases where \Xyce{} will improperly run a simulation with an incomplete argument list
for a user-defined function.  

\textbf{\textit{Workaround}}: None, other than using \Xyce{}
user-defined functions correctly. \\ \hline  

\textbf{812-SON}: Undocumented limitations on, and bugs with, parameter and global 
parameter names & Based on external customer input and pre-release testing, there are
some bugs and undocumented limitations on parameter and global parameter names in 
\Xyce{}. Parameters and global parameters should start with a letter, rather than with a
number or ``special'' character like \#.  In addition, the use of a single 
character $V$ as a global parameter name can result in either netlist parsing failures
or incorrect results from \texttt{.PRINT} lines.  \\ \hline

\textbf{807-SON}: BSIM4 convergence problems with non-zero rgatemod value &
There have been reports of convergence problems (e.g., the \Xyce{} simulation
fails part way through and says that the ``time step is too small'')  when the 
\texttt{rgatemod} parameter is non-zero. \\ \hline

\textbf{805-SON}: Parser fails to collect linear mutual inductors in an include file & 
\Xyce{} will fail to collect component inductors together, into a mutual inductor, when
they are in an include file rather than in the top-level netlist file.  
\textbf{\textit{Workaround}}: Move the relevant L and K device statements into 
the top-level circuit. \\ \hline

\textbf{794-SON}: Bug in TABLE Form of Xyce Controlled Sources & In some case, a \Xyce{}
netlist with a controlled source, that uses the TABLE form, will get the correct answer 
at first.  However, it may then "stall" (e.g, keep taking really small time-steps)
and never complete the simulation run.  

\textbf{\textit{Workaround}}: In some cases, the TABLE specification for the controlled
source can be replaced with a Piecewise Linear (PWL) source that uses nested IF 
statements. \\ \hline

\textbf{785-SON}: Xyce hangs in parallel when passed a directory rather than a file &
This bug is related to SON Bug 730 (``Xyce hangs when passed a directory instead of a 
netlist ''), which was fixed in Xyce 6.5.  Further testing has shown that \Xyce{}
will hang (during parallel execution) if a directory is used, rather than a file, in
\texttt{.LIB} or \texttt{.INC} statements.  \Xyce{} may also hang in parallel if
the ``output file'' is either a directory or a file in a non-existent directory.
This can happen with either the \texttt{FILE=} keyword on a \texttt{.PRINT} line or
with the \texttt{-o} command line option. \\ \hline

\textbf{783-SON}: Use of ddt in a B-Source definition may produce incorrect results  & The \texttt{DDT()} 
function from the \Xyce{} expression package, which implements a time derivative, may not function 
correctly in a B-Source definition.

\textbf{\textit{Workaround}}: None. \\ \hline

\textbf{727-SON}: Xyce parallel builds hang randomly on OS X & During Sandia's internal 
nightly testing of the OSX parallel builds, we see that \Xyce{} ``hangs on exit'' with an 
estimated frequency of less than 1-in-5000 simulation runs.  We have not seen this issue 
with parallel builds for either RHEL6 or BSD.  The hang is on exit, whether on a successful 
exit or on an error exit.  The hang occurs after all of the \Xyce{} output has occurred though.  
So, the user will get their sim results, but might have trouble if the individual \Xyce{} runs 
are part of a larger script.

\textbf{\textit{Workaround}}: None. \\ \hline

\textbf{718-SON}: Missing error message for invalid nodes in expressions on .PRINT lines & If an invalid node
is specified on a \Xyce{} \texttt{.PRINT TRAN} line then \Xyce{} should return a fatal error during netlist
parsing (e.g., \texttt{.PRINT TRAN V(BOGONODE)} will produce an error message of \texttt{undefined 
symbol in .PRINT command: node BOGONODE}, if \texttt{BOGONODE} does not exist in the netlist).  However, if the
invalid node is inside a \Xyce{} expression (e.g., \texttt{.PRINT TRAN \{V(BOGONODE)\}}) then \Xyce{} will 
not produce an error message during netlist parsing and the output value for \texttt{\{V(BOGONODE)\}} will 
be zero for all time-steps.

\textbf{\textit{Workaround}}: There is none, other than noticing that an output waveform value is 
unexpectedly all zeroes, and correcting the \texttt{.PRINT} statement. \\ \hline

\textbf{715-SON}: I(*) for subcircuit nodes does not work properly on .PRINT lines & 
\texttt{.PRINT TRAN I(*)} works for nodes at the top-level of the netlist.  However, it will
fail during netlist parsing if there are nodes in subcircuits.  The error message will be 
something like \texttt{Function or variable I(V:X1:1) is not defined}.

\textbf{\textit{Workaround}}: Explicitly put the desired lead or branch currents, using the
fully qualified device names, in the \texttt{.PRINT} statement. \\ \hline

\textbf{707-SON}: Behavior for invalid nodes on .FOUR lines and in .MEASURE statements &
There are issues with \texttt{.FOUR} lines and \texttt{.MEASURE} statements that accidentally
use node names that are not in the netlist.  In that case, the \texttt{.cir.four} output file 
will contain a mix of all zero's and NaN's, and \Xyce{} will not produce a warning or error 
message about the invalid node name.  Similarly, the measure statement will run without a 
warning message about the invalid node name.  The measure result will then be zero, rather than 
FAILED. \\ \hline

\textbf{661-SON} Branch Currents and Power Accessors (I(), P() and W()) Do Not Work 
Properly in .RESULT Statements  & There are two issues.  First, \texttt{.RESULT} statements 
will fail netlist parsing if the requested branch current is omitted from the \texttt{.PRINT TRAN} 
line.  As an example, this statement (\texttt{.RESULT I(R1)}) requires either \texttt{I(R1)},
\texttt{P(R1)} or \texttt{W(R1)} to be on the \texttt{.PRINT TRAN} line.  Second, the
output value, in the \texttt{.res} file, for the lead current or power calculation will 
always be zero.
\\ \hline 

\textbf{652-SON}: HB output is buggy & While a straightforward use of \texttt{.print HB} works as described in the users and reference guides, several of the documented features do not work as intended.

\texttt{.print HB\_FD} and \texttt{.print HB\_TD} are intended as a way of specifying variable lists for frequency- and time-domain outputs, respectively.  It has been discovered that these only produce output if there are print specifications for {\em both\/} frequency and time domain.  That is, if only one of \texttt{.print HB\_FD} or \texttt{.print HB\_TD} is present in the netlist, no output will be produced at all.   

\textbf{\textit{Workaround}}: When performing harmonic balance analysis, always specify enough print lines so that both time- and frequency-domain variables are output.  This could be by specifing \texttt{.print HB} alone, by specifying both \texttt{.print HB} and \texttt{.print HB\_TD}, or by specifying both \texttt{.print HB\_FD} and \texttt{.print HB\_TD}.
\\ \hline


\textbf{583-SON}: Switch with RON=0 leads to convergence failure. &  The switch device does not prevent a user from specifying \texttt{RON=0} in its model, but then takes the inverse of this value to get the ``on'' conductance.  The resulting invalid division will either lead to a division by zero error on platforms that throw such errors, or produce a conductance with ``Not A Number'' or ``Infinity'' as value.  This will lead to a convergence failure.

\textbf{\textit{Workaround}}: Do not specify an identically zero resistance for the switch's ``on'' value.  A small value of resistance such as 1e-15 or smaller will generally work well as a substitute. \\ \hline


\textbf{469-SON}: Belos memory consumption on FreeBSD and excessive CPU on other
platforms &
Memory or thread bloat can result when using multithreaded dense linear algebra
libraries, which are employed by Belos.  If this situation is observed, either build
\Xyce{} with a serial dense linear algebra library or use environment variables to control
the number of spawned threads in a multithreaded library.
\\ \hline


\textbf{468-SON}: It should be legal to have two model cards with the same model
name, but different model types. & SPICE3F5 and ngspice only require that
model cards of the same type have unique model names. They accept model cards
of different types with the same name.  \Xyce{} requires that all model card names be unique.
\\ \hline


\textbf{250-SON}: NODESET in Xyce is not equivalent to NODESET in SPICE & As
currently implemented, \texttt{.NODESET} applies the initial conditions given throughout
a full nonlinear solve for the operating point, then uses the result as an
initial guess for a second nonlinear solve with no constraints.  This is not
the same as SPICE, which merely applies the given initial conditions to a
single nonlinear solve for the first two iterations, then lets the problem
converge with no further constraints.  This can lead to a \Xyce{} \texttt{.NODESET} failing
where the same netlist in SPICE might not, if the initial conditions are such
that a full nonlinear solve cannot converge with those constraints in place.
There is no workaround.
\\ \hline

\textbf{247-SON}: Expressions don't work on .options lines & Expressions enclosed
in braces (\{ \}) are handled specially throughout \Xyce{}, and may only be used
in certain contexts such as in device model or instance parameters or on
\texttt{.PRINT} lines.
\\ \hline


\textbf{49-SON} Xyce BSIM models recognize the model TNOM, but not the
instance TNOM & Some simulators allow the model parameter TNOM of BSIM devices to be specified on the instance line, overriding the model parameter TNOM.  \Xyce{} does not support this.
\\ \hline

\textbf{37-SON}: Connectivity checking is broken for devices with more than 10
leads & The diagnostic code used by the \Xyce{} setup that checks circuit
topology for basic errors such as a node having no DC path to ground or a node
being connected to only one device has a bug in it that causes the code to emit
a cryptic error message, after which the code will exit.  This error has so far
only been seen when a user has attempted to connect a large number of inductors
together using multiple mutual inductor lines.  The maximum number of
non-ground leads that can be used without confusing this piece of code is 10.
If your circuit has that type of large, highly-connected mutual inductor and
the code exits with an error message, this bug may be the source of the problem.

The error message now includes a recommendation to use the workaround below.

\textbf{\textit{Workaround}}: Disable connectivity checking by adding the line

\begin{alltt} .OPTIONS TOPOLOGY CHECK_CONNECTIVITY=0 \end{alltt}

to your netlist.  This will disable the check for the basic errors such as
floating nodes and improperly connected devices, but will allow the netlist to
run with a highly-connected mutual inductor.
\\ \hline


\textbf{27-SON}: Fix handling of .options parameters & When specifying .options
  for a particular package, what gets applied as the non-specified default
  options might change.  \\ \hline

\textbf{1962-SRN}: Voltages from interface nodes for subcircuits may not work
correctly in expressions on \texttt{.PRINT} lines & An expression that uses a 
voltage from an interface node to a subcircuit on a \texttt{.PRINT} line 
may only work if that voltage node is also used outside of the expression on 
the \texttt{.PRINT} line.  A simple example is as follows.  The expression 
\texttt{\{V(X1:a)*I(X1:R1)\}} prints out as 0, unless \texttt{V(X1:a)} is also on 
the \texttt{.PRINT} line.
\\ \hline

\textbf{1923-SRN}: LC lines run out of memory, even if equivalent (larger) RLC
lines do not. &  In some cases, circuits that run fine using an RLC approximation for a
transmission line, exit with an out-of-memory error if the (supposedly smaller) LC
approximation is used.
\\ \hline

\textbf{1903-SRN}: Xyce fails to collect several inductors into a linear mutual inductor &
In some rare cases with complex include file usage, the mutual inductor syntax with multiple couplings can fail to work. \Xyce{} will return an error message that it can not find 
\texttt{L\_L1}:
{\tt
\begin{verbatim}
L_L1         node1 node1 inductance1
L_L2         node3 node4  inductance2
L_L3         node5  node6  inductance3
L_L4         node7 node8  inductance4
K_K1         L_L1 L_L2 L_L3 L_L4   .999 
\end{verbatim}
}

\\ \hline

\textbf{1595-SRN}: \Xyce{} won't allow access to inductors within subcircuits for
mutual inductors external to subcircuits & It is not possible to have a mutual
inductor outside of a subcircuit couple to inductors in a subcircuit.

\textbf{\textit{Workaround}}: Put all inductors and mutual inductance lines that couple to
them together at the same level of circuit hierarchy.
