\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section*{Highlights}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Xyce now handles local variation with the same netlist convention as
      HSPICE and other simulators.  This allows users to more easily simulate
      things like mismatch using commercial PDKs.

\item The parser, expression library and device package have undergone various
      efficiency improvements with respect to parameter handling.  In the case
      of the parser, this speeds up parsing in many cases.  For the device
      package, it speeds up analysis.  In the case of the expression library, it
      often speeds up both parsing and analysis.
\end{XyceItemize}

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The Xyce diode now supports sidewall effects supported by other
  simulators such as ngspice and HSPICE.
\item The open source version of Xyce now includes the published
  version of EKV MOSFET model version 2.6 as the level 260 MOSFET.
  Previously, this model was only available in our ``non free''
  binaries.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}

\item The expression library \texttt{TABLE} and \texttt{SPLINE} operators now
     support a ``downsampling'' feature, in which the user can request that a
     large data file can automatically have the number of points used by the
     source reduced.  For \texttt{TABLE} based sources, which are based on a
     PWL linear approximation, this can dramatically speed up simulations, as
     the number of required breakpoints is reduced.

\item The random operators in the expression library (such as \texttt{AGAUSS}
     and \texttt{AUNIF}) now support implicit local and global variation,
     consistent with other simulators.

\item Parameter handling in the parser has been refactored. As a result, the
     parsing and setup time for large process design kits (PDKs) has been
     improved.

\end{XyceItemize}

\subsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Subcircuit multipliers (\texttt{M=}) previously had to have a fixed value.
  Now, they can be treated like any other parameter, and can change during a simulation
  using commands such as \texttt{.STEP}.

\item Formatting errors in unused subcircuit definitions (\texttt{.SUBCKT}) will no
  longer emit errors, only warnings.  This is limited to issues in the (\texttt{.SUBCKT})
  line of the netlist.  If additional parsing issues are found within the subcircuit
  definition, they may still result in an error being emitted from the simulator.

\item \Xyce{} now has a diagnostic option, \texttt{.options diagnostic} to aid in
  debugging of user circuits.  This option can be used to output nodes with extreme
  solution values, voltages, currents and discontinuities during a simulation.
  Additionally, it can provide information on continuation methods used during
  the DC Operating point calculation.  See the Reference Guide section 2.1.25.2
  and chapter 10 the User's Guide for more details.

\item The third argument (\texttt{num\_sigma}) to the random expression
     operators \texttt{AGAUSS} and \texttt{GAUSS} is now optional.

\item The metrics tracking and reporting feature now has an option to include
  error messages. When enabled, the tracking data reported by Xyce is encoded as
  a JSON string. If certain error conditions occur, the JSON string may now
  include a list of diagnostic messages. These error messages will be encoded as
  an array under the tag name “ErrorMessages” next to the “audit” field
  (e.g. {“audit”:\{\dots\},”ErrorMessages”:[\dots]}).

\item Expressions are now allowed on the following analysis lines:
     \texttt{.TRAN}, \texttt{.DC} and \texttt{.AC}.

\item Data files read in via the expression library operators such as
     \texttt{TABLE} and \texttt{TABLEFILE} can now contain comments.

\item Data files read in via the expression library operators such as
     \texttt{TABLE} and \texttt{TABLEFILE} can now include dashes in the
     filename.

\item When running a frequency domain analysis such as \texttt{.HB} or
     \texttt{.AC}, complex-valued expressions on the \texttt{.PRINT} line will
     now automatically output both the real and imaginary parts.

\item \texttt{.params} can now be complex-valued.  When used in a real-valued
     context, only the real part will be used, but in complex (i.e. frequency
     domain) contexts, complex arithmetic is performed.

\end{XyceItemize}


\subsection*{XDM}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Fixed bug where an instance of a SPECTRE device is not translated as an
    instance or a comment if it appears after a definition of a SPECTRE device.
\end{XyceItemize}
