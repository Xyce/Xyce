  \textbf{Xyce Project Backlog/492}: Subcircuit multiliplier
  parameters (\texttt{M}) need to be handled as an AST (enabling .STEP
  to be applied to subcircuit \texttt{M}) & This task was related to
  backlog isssue 494.  In the initial implementation of subcircuit
  multipliers, they were constrained to have fixed values.  However,
  in some cases a user may wish to change multiplier values during a
  simulation.  To enable this feature, the subcircuit multiplier
  parameters had to be part of the same abstract syntax tree (AST) as
  other parameters from the netlist.  This has been fixed.  \\ \hline

  \textbf{Xyce Project Backlog/494}: Remove parser error trap for
  using \texttt{.global\_param} on the implicit subcircuit multiplier
  parameter (M) & The subcircuit multiplier parameter, \texttt{M}, is
  treated as a special case in the \Xyce{} parser.  Due to its special
  treatment, the use case of setting this parameter via a mutable
  parameter (i.e.  \texttt{.global\_param} ) did not work correctly.
  This has been fixed. This issue did not apply to device multipliers,
  just to subcircuit multipliers.  \\ \hline

  \textbf{Xyce Project Bugs/35}: Xyce/ADMS does not allow ceil and
  floor in analog functions & A mistake in the code for generating
  analog function derivatives caused any analog function that used
  ceil or floor to abort processing of an entire Verilog-A model.
  This mistake has been fixed and now ceil and floor can be used
  inside analog functions \\ \hline

  \textbf{Xyce Project Bugs/27}: Transient adjoint sensitivity doesn't
  correctly handle scaling & Sensitivity analysis in \Xyce{} can
  optionally scale sensitivity values by \texttt{p/100},
  where \texttt{p} is the original value of the sensitivity parameter.
  This particular capability was never implemented for transient
  adjoints, which was an oversight.  This has been fixed.  \\ \hline
