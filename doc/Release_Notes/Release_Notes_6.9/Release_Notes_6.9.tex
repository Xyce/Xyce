\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

For up-to-date information not available at the time these notes were produced,

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The VBIC 1.2 (Level=10) model has been deprecated since \Xyce{} Release
     6.6.  It is still available in \Xyce{} 6.9, but is unmaintained and will
     be removed in a future release.  To remind users that this model is slated
     for future removal, \Xyce{} will show the text ``\texttt{*DEPRECATED*}''
     next to the model name in the device count summary.

\item The Analog Behavioral Modeling (ABM) devices have been improved to handle
     ``instantaneous transitions'' which, for example, can be caused by IF
     statements in controlled sources.  Those instantaneous transitions can
     cause convergence problems.  The improved ABM devices can now provide
     smooth transitions in the simulation, and that feature can be enabled by
     specifying device options and instance parameters.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
 \item \Xyce{} now provides three different device distribution strategies that
      can be controlled through the `\texttt{.OPTIONS DIST}' control line in
      the netlist.  For flattened or post-layout netlists, these new strategies
      can provide improved parsing and simulation performance.  See the Users'
      Guide chapter on ``Guidance for Running Xyce in Parallel.''
 \end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Expression library now supports \texttt{floor} and \texttt{ceil} functions.
  \item Connectivity checker that ensures all voltage nodes have a DC path to
       ground has been fixed to remove limit of 10 lead groups.  Parallel
       implementation of this check has been rewritten to eliminate performance
       issues.
  \item The -o command line option (which places the simulation results into
       the specified file) may be deprecated in a future release.  See the entry 
       for SON Bug 911 in
       the Fixed Defect Table for the recommended usage of the FILE= qualifier
       for .PRINT lines.
  \item .MEASURE and -remeasure are now supported for .DC analyses.
  \item Doping profiles for one-dimensional TCAD devices can now be specified
       using expressions.
  \item It is now possible to explicitly set time integration breakpoints from
       the netlist.
  \item It is now possible to specify a list of discrete timepoints for output.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Deployment Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Important new information regarding use of OpenMPI on Linux systems has
       been added to the Users' Guide ``Guidance for Running Xyce in Parallel''
       chapter.  \emph{It is recommended that all users of parallel Xyce on Linux
       read this new section!}
