\textbf{xxx-SON}: place holder title &
place holder description  \\ \hline

\textbf{1204-SON}: Fix issue with extra blank lines in Touchstone 1 formatted output
for .LIN analysis & There could be extra blank lines inserted in the Touchstone 1
formatted output, between the S-parameter values output for each frequency, if a
\texttt{.LIN} analysis used any number of ports other than 2.  The Touchstone 2
formatted output, which is the default output format for \texttt{.LIN} analyses,
was not affected by this bug. \\ \hline

\textbf{1202-SON}: Fix segfaults caused by using .LIN SPARCALC=1 in a netlist
without any port (P) devices & The use of a \texttt{.LIN} line with the
parameter \texttt{SPARCALC} set to 1 in a netlist that requested a \texttt{.AC}
analysis without any valid port (P) devices in the netlist would cause
\Xyce{} to segfault. \\ \hline

\textbf{1198-SON}: Binning doesn't work for BSIM6 and other models in the ADMS directory &
Binning (the kind enabled by \texttt{.options parser
model\_binning=true} did not work properly for several MOSFET models
derived from Verilog-A, because the authors of those models had not
included the dummy
parameters \textbf{LMIN}, \textbf{LMAX}, \textbf{WMIN},
and \textbf{WMAX}.  These dummy parameters are not used directly by
any model, but must be present in order for the binning code to select
the correct model card from a collection of cards based on
the \textbf{L} and \textbf{W} parameter on the instance line.  These
models were BSIM6, PSP102, MVSG-HV, and the non-free EKV models.
Dummy parameters have been added for all these models and they should
now work with binning. \\ \hline

\textbf{1197-SON}: Allow dependent parameters, other than C and Q, for
the C-device that use expressions without solution variables in them &
The C and Q instance parameters are allowed to be solution-dependent
for the C-device.  In \Xyce{} 6.11, or earlier, an attempt to use an
expression (that did not depend on solution variables such as nodal voltages)
in the definition of other parameters, such as TEMP, for the C device
would cause a parsing error.  This is fixed now.
\\ \hline

\textbf{1196-SON}: -hspice-ext math command line option fails on .FUNC
statements the use Logical OR and Logical AND & The \texttt{-hspice-ext}
command line option would fail on \texttt{.FUNC} statements that contained
logical OR or logical AND operators.  Examples were as follows, where
\texttt{P1} and \texttt{P2} were previously defined on \texttt{.PARAM}
lines:
\begin{verbatim}
.FUNC ANDFUNC(p1,p2) {(P1&&P2) ? 1.0 : 2.0}
.FUNC ORFUNC(p1,p2)  {(P1||P2) ? 1.0 : 2.0}
\end{verbatim}
\\ \hline

\textbf{1188-SON}: Various ill-formed .DATA, .DC and .STEP lines could cause
\Xyce{} to segfault & An attempt to use \texttt{.DATA}, \texttt{.DC} or
\texttt{.STEP} lines with less than the required number of elements on
those lines could cause \Xyce{} to segfault.  In addition, the error
messages emitted for invalid uses of \texttt{DATA=<tableName>} on
\texttt{.AC} \texttt{.DC} and \texttt{.STEP} lines, or for ill-formed
\texttt{.DATA} statements, could be cryptic and unhelpful.
\\ \hline

\textbf{989-SON}: I(*) will not print branch currents that are part of a Y
device & Until this release of \Xyce{}, the I(*) feature of
the \texttt{.PRINT} would not output any branch currents (extra
solution variables describing internal currents of a device)
associated with Y devices.  No Y devices in \Xyce{} have such branch
currents, but Y devices imported from Verilog-A plugins could.  These
branch currents are now output by I(*).
