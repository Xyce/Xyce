\begin{document}
\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The PSP103.4 model with self heating has been added as the level 1031 MOSFET.
\item The Xyce/ADMS code generation back-end has been improved to
  \begin{XyceItemize}
    \item allow handling of analog functions with output variables
      other than their return value.
    \item support the standard Verilog-A ``hypot'' function.
    \item generate analytic derivatives without the use of Sacado.
      This refactor allows Xyce/ADMS to produce C++ code that
      evaluates model residuals and jacobians much more efficiently
      than before.
  \end{XyceItemize}
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Improved direct solver performance and reductions in general
  memory usage has been achieved through modifications to the topology
  layer.
\item The time step recovery algorithm is now considered deprecated.
  It will be removed in a future version of \Xyce{}.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Sweep loops for \texttt{.NOISE} analyses can now be specified using the
  HSpice-style \texttt{.DATA} command.  This allows the user to specify parameter
  loops in which multiple parameters are changed simultaneously.  Previously,
  this capability only applied to  \texttt{.STEP}, \texttt{.DC} and \texttt{.AC}
  analyses.
\item A new SPLOT print format that outputs data in standard columns,
  like a .prn file, but with improved compatibility for .STEP data with
  the splot command in gnuplot.
\item RF parameter operators (e.g., S(1,1), SR(1,1), SI(1,1), SM(1,1),
SP(1,1), SDB(1,1) and their corresponding Y- and Z-parameter versions)
were added. Those operators work on both .PRINT AC and .MEASURE lines.
\item  The \verb|.LIN| command, for S-parameter analysis, can now also
output Y- or Z-parameter data into its Touchstone 1 or Touchstone 2
output files via a newly added \texttt{LINTYPE} argument.
\item It is now possible to add a \texttt{STEPNUM} column as the first column
in an output file, via \texttt{.OPTIONS OUTPUT ADD\_STEPNUM\_COL}.
This new option improves the compatibility of \Xyce{} output with gnuplot.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Important Announcements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The \Xyce{} project is no longer providing binaries for RHEL6.
  This system is close to its end of life, and Sandia has been
  decommissioning its RHEL6 systems.
\item The model interpolation technique described in the \Xyce{}
  Reference Guide in section 2.1.18 has been marked as deprecated, and
  will be removed in a future release of Xyce.
\item It has been determined that some distributions of Linux have
  broken builds of OpenMPI in their package repositories.  Building
  \Xyce{} from source code in parallel with these OpenMPI installs
  will result in a version of \Xyce{} that may crash on some problems.
  This is not a bug in \Xyce{}, but a packaging error of the OpenMPI
  package on those operating systems.  Please see commentary in the
  ``Known Defects'' section of these release notes under bug number
  ``967-SON''.
\item \Xyce{} has deprecated the default conversion of quoted-string file
  names to a table of x,y pairs of data.  The old convention of
  \texttt{PARAMETER="file.dat"} which worked in some model statements
  and in behavioral sources will now generate a warning in the \Xyce{}
  output.  The correct way to specify a file of data for a parameter
  is to use the new \texttt{tablefile} keyword as in
  \texttt{PARAMETER=tablefile("file.dat")}.  While this release of
  \Xyce{} will accept both the old and new syntax, the double quote
  technique will be removed in a future release, after which Xyce
  will only accept the syntax of
  \texttt{PARAMETER=tablefile("file.dat")}.  Additionally, a new
  syntax of \texttt{PARAMETER=string("string value")} has been
  introduced to specify parameters that are pure strings.  This will
  be deprecated in a future release and the simpler syntax of
  \texttt{PARAMETER="string value"} will be used to specify string
  valued parameters.
\item The ``Xygra'' device, which was written as a special-purpose
  coupling mechanism to ALEGRA but which has occasionally been used
  for other coupling problems, has been marked as deprecated.  The
  new, more flexible ``General External'' device was created to take
  its place, and has supplanted the use of Xygra in ALEGRA.  The Xygra
  device and the API that enables it may be removed without notice in
  a future release of \Xyce{}. If your code has been using the Xygra
  capability to couple to Xyce, you must replace your usage with the
  new capability.  The ``General External'' coupling mechanism is
  documented thoroughly in an application note available on the
  \Xyce{} web site.
\item The minimum required version of Trilinos has changed.  Please
  consult the ``Building Guide'' page on the \Xyce{} website for more
  details.
