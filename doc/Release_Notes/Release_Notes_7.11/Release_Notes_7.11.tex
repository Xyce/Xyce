The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item The BSIM SOI version 4.7.0 has been added as the level 70470 MOSFET.  It has been observed that the \Xyce{} implementation of this model may be less robust than the previous version, 4.6.1.  For this reason, version 4.6.1 is still level 70.  Additionally, the older BSIM-SOI 4.5.0 continues to be the level 70450 MOSFET.
  \item The BSIM SOI version 4.6.1 had a capacitance bug that has been fixed.  (see issue 988 in the fixed defects table).  This was originally noticed a long time ago.  It was left unfixed until recently because the official version of this model from the BSIM group didn't include a fix.   But, after empirically observing that several commercial simulators had clearly fixed their own implementations of 4.6.1, the decision was made to fix the \Xyce{} implementation.
