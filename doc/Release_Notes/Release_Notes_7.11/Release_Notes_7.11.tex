The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{XDM}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item 
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item The BSIM SOI version 4.7.0 has been added as the level 70470 MOSFET.  It has been observed that the \Xyce{} implementation of this model may be less robust than the previous version, 4.6.1.  For this reason, version 4.6.1 is still level 70.  Additionally, the older BSIM-SOI 4.5.0 continues to be the level 70450 MOSFET.
  \item The BSIM SOI version 4.6.1 had a capacitance bug that has been fixed.  (see issue 988 in the fixed defects table).  This was originally noticed a long time ago.  It was left unfixed until recently because the official version of this model from the BSIM group didn't include a fix.   But, after empirically observing that several commercial simulators had clearly fixed their own implementations of 4.6.1, the decision was made to fix the \Xyce{} implementation.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}


\item Add new items here
\item Most independent sources now have analytical sensitivity functions implemented. (see issue 849 in the fixed defects table)  Previously, sensitivities with respect to independent source parameters had to rely on finite differences.  With analytical derivatives, sensitivity analysis will be more accurate and faster run times.

\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Independent PWL sources now support sensitivity analysis (see issue 849 in the fixed defects table).
\end{XyceItemize}
