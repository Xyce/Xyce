  PSpice models cards for resistors, capacitors and inductors. &  \texttt{R} and
  \texttt{RES} are now synonyms in \texttt{.MODEL} statements for resistors.
  \texttt{C} and \texttt{CAP} are now synonyms in \texttt{.MODEL} statements for capacitors.
  \texttt{L} and \texttt{IND} are now synonyms in \texttt{.MODEL} statements for inductors.
