\section{Scope/Product Definition}

The \Xyce{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support, in a
rigorous manner, the simulation needs of the Sandia National Laboratories
electrical designers.  Specific requirements include, among others, the
ability to solve extremely large circuit problems by supporting large-scale
parallel computing platforms, improved numerical performance and
object-oriented code design and implementation.

The \Xyce{} release notes describe:
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Hardware and software requirements
  \item New features and enhancements
  \item Any defects fixed since the last release
  \item Current known defects and defect workarounds
  \item Incompatibilities With Other Circuit Simulators
\end{XyceItemize}

For up-to-date information not available at the time these notes 
were produced, please visit the \Xyce{} web page at

\section{Hardware/Software}
This section gives basic information on supported platforms and hardware
and software requirements for running \Xyce{} 6.2.

\subsection{Supported Platforms (Certified Support)}
\Xyce\ 6.2 currently supports any of the following operating system platforms
(all versions imply the earliest supported---\Xyce{} generally works on later
versions as well).  These platforms are supported in the sense that they have
been subject to certification testing for the \Xyce{} version 6.2 release.  

\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Red Hat Enterprise Linux${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$ 5, x86 (serial only) and x86-64 (serial and parallel)
\item Red Hat Enterprise Linux${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$ 6, x86-64 (serial and parallel)
\item Microsoft Windows 7${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$, x86 (serial)
\item Apple${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$ OS X, x86-64 (serial and parallel)
\item TLCC (serial and parallel)
\item Red Sky (serial and parallel)
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsection{Build Supported Platforms (not Certified)}
The platforms listed in this section are ``not supported'' in the
sense that they are not subject to nightly regression testing, and
they also were not subject to certification testing for the \Xyce{}
version 6.2 release.  Despite this lack of testing rigor, \Xyce{} has
been known to run under these configurations.

\begin{XyceItemize}
\item FreeBSD 9.x on Intel x86 and x86-64 architectures (serial and parallel)
\item Distributions of Linux other than Red Hat Enterprise Linux
\item Microsoft Windows under Cygwin and MinGW.
\end{XyceItemize}

Please contact the Xyce development team for platform and configuration availability.

\subsection{Hardware Requirements}

The \Xyce{} team has not determined a minimum memory or processor
speed requirement.  Any modern computer should have enough memory and
processor power to run moderately sized circuits in serial with
\Xyce{}.  Naturally, memory requirements grow with problem size.  

Running \Xyce{} in parallel will require a system with at least two
processors. For problems of the size where parallel operation is
beneficial (thousands of devices per processor), one can expect to
need several gigabytes of memory per processor. 

For the very largest problems that \Xyce{} can run (millions of
devices), one will require a cluster system with a sufficient number
of nodes to distribute the problem efficiently, and sufficient memory
per node to support the distributed problem.  

\subsection{Software Requirements}
Several libraries are required to run \Xyce{} or build \Xyce{} from source on a
platform.  Serial versions of the \Xyce{} binary have no run-time software
requirements, as they ship with all the shared libraries they need.  However,
parallel versions require Open MPI
({\color{XyceDeepRed}\url{http://www.open-mpi.org/}}) (version 1.4 or higher)
at run time.  TLCC and Red Sky users can load the \textbf{xyce} module to properly
set the environment. 

Several libraries (all freely available from Sandia National Laboratories or
other sites) are always required when building \Xyce{} from source.  These are:
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Trilinos Solver Library version 11.10.2
  ({\color{XyceDeepRed}\url{http://trilinos.org}}).  Trilinos is a suite of
  packages that includes solver and partitioning libraries in parallel and
  serial, in addition to many other utilites.
\item UMFPACK version 4.1 and AMD version 1.0 (libumfpack.a, libamd.a)
  ({\color{XyceDeepRed}
  \url{http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/}}).  This is also
  provided by the SuiteSparse package that is available on many systems.
\item BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms). This may be included with the
  compiler, or it may require separate package installation. One may also use
  ATLAS ({\color{XyceDeepRed} \url{http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net}}).
\item LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage). This may be included with the
  compiler, or it may require separate package installation. One may also use
  ATLAS ({\color{XyceDeepRed} \url{http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net}}).
\end{XyceItemize}
For parallel builds, the following libraries are additionally required:
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Open MPI ({\color{XyceDeepRed}\url{http://www.open-mpi.org}}) library for
  message passing (version 1.4 or higher).  The version used to build Xyce must
  be the same that is used for building Trilinos.
\item ParMETIS ({\color{XyceDeepRed}
  \url{http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/parmetis/overview}}) library for
  graph partitioning (version 3.1 or higher).  The MPI compiler used to compile
  ParMETIS must be the same that is used for Trilinos and Xyce.
\end{XyceItemize}

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

Highlights for \Xyce{} Release 6.2 include:
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Transient direct sensitivities.
  \item Support lead current calculation and output for Harmonic Balance (HB) analysis.
  \item Improved interpolation for both the Trapezoid and Gear
    time integrators.
  \item Improved results output (.PRINT) capabilities.
  \item Lumped tranmission line model.
  \item Support for a new digital latch (DLTCH) model.
  \item Multiple .PRINT's result in multiple output files.
  \item GMIN stepping is attempted automatically if the initial attempt to find
    a DC operating point fails.
  \item ``\%'' no longer a reserved character in names.
  \item ``!'' is a reserved character in names to separate device name from ancillary information.
\end{XyceItemize}
For details of each of these new features, see the \Xyce{} Users' Guide, the
\Xyce{} Installation Guide, and the \Xyce{} Reference Guide.  A more complete
listing of new features and improvements is given in the following sections.

\subsection{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Transient direct sensitivity analysis.  This is an enhancement to {\texttt{.SENS}},
which previously only applied to steady-state (.DC) analysis.
\item New nonlinear solution strategy similar to SPICE, so that when the standard Newton method fails to get a DC Operating Point (DCOP), GMIN stepping is automatically attempted.  This new strategy is now default behavior in \Xyce{}.
