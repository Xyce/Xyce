The \texttt{FORMAT=RAW} print format for homotopy output has changed &
The \texttt{FORMAT=RAW} print format is still unsupported for homotopy 
output.  However, it now defaults to \texttt{FORMAT=STD} with the file 
extension of .HOMOTOPY.prn. In earlier versions of \Xyce{}, the 
file extension was .HOMOTOPY.unknown. \\ \hline

The \texttt{FORMAT=PROBE} and \texttt{FORMAT=RAW} print formats for noise
output have changed & Those two print formats are still unsupported for 
noise output.  However, they now default to \texttt{FORMAT=STD} with the 
file  extensions of .NOISE.prn. In earlier versions of \Xyce{}, their 
file extensions were .NOISE\_unknown. \\ \hline

A \texttt{.PRINT HOMOTOPY} line is now required to get homotopy output
during a .transient simulation &  In previous versions of \Xyce{}, the 
contents of the \texttt{.PRINT TRAN} line was used to generate homotopy
output during a transient simulation if there was no \texttt{.PRINT 
HOMOTOPY} line in the netlist.  An explicit \texttt{.PRINT HOMOTOPY}
line is now required for all analyses types in order to generate 
\Xyce{} homotopy output.  \\ \hline

The simulation footers for \texttt{.PRINT HOMOTOPY} and \texttt{.PRINT SENS}
have changed slightly & For the \texttt{FORMAT=STD}, \texttt{FORMAT=GNUPLOT} 
and \texttt{FORMAT=TECPLOT} print formats, \texttt{.PRINT HOMOTOPY} will now print 
the simulation footer ``End of Xyce(TM) Homotopy Simulation'' for all simulations 
(with and without \texttt{.STEP}).  Similarly, \texttt{.PRINT SENS} will now
print the simulation footer ``End of Xyce(TM) Sensitivity Simulation'' for 
all simulations (with and without \texttt{.STEP}). \\ \hline
