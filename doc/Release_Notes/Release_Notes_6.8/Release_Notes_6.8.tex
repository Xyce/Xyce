\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

For up-to-date information not available at the time these notes were produced,

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item A code optimization of the BSIM-CMG model 110 (MOSFET level 110)
  has improved performance of this model when self-heating effects are
  disabled by setting SHMOD=0 or RTH=0 in the .model card.
  
\item The VBIC 1.2 (Level=10) model has been deprecated since \Xyce{}
  Release 6.6.  It is still available in \Xyce{} 6.8, but is
  unmaintained and will be removed in a future release.  To remind
  users that this model is slated for future removal, \Xyce{} will show
  the text ``*DEPRECATED*'' next to the model name in its device count
  summary.

  The VBIC 1.3 model (levels 11 and 12) will be the only supported
  VBIC models in the future.  Please update any netlists you have that
  use the level=10 model to use one of these VBIC 1.3 models instead.
  See the \Xyce{} Reference Guide for details on the differences between
  the 1.2 and 1.3 versions of VBIC.

  Users are advised to update their VBIC netlists as soon as possible.
  
\item The Piecewise Empirical Model (PEM) memristor model has been added to \Xyce{}.  See the 
  \Xyce{} Reference Guide for details.
  
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
 \item The BDF time integration method (METHOD=BDF or METHOD=6) has
   been deprecated since version 6.6 of \Xyce{}, and has been removed in
   this release. The Trapezoid (METHOD=TRAP or METHOD=7) and Gear
   (METHOD=GEAR or METHOD=8) methods are the only supported time
   integration methods in version 6.8.  Please update any netlists you
   have that explicitly use the BDF time integration method to use the
   Gear method instead.

 \item Improved robustness of GMIN stepping and SPICE DC OP strategy.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The CSV print format is now supported for homotopy and noise output.
\item A new GNUPLOT print format that outputs data in standard columns, like a
.prn file, but with improved Gnuplot compatibility for .STEP data.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Deployment Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The wrapper scripts \texttt{runxyce} and \texttt{xmpirun} are no
  longer provided by our packaged installers.  \Xyce{} is now run
  directly without the use of these scripts.  For details please see
  the \Xyce{} Users' Guide.
\item This version of \Xyce{} has been built against the latest
  released version 12.12.1 of Trilinos.
\item \Xyce{} no longer requires the UMFPACK library for serial builds 
  and neither UMFPACK nor ParMETIS are required for parallel builds.
\end{XyceItemize}
