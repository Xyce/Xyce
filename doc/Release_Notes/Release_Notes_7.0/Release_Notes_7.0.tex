\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{XDM}
The netlist translator, XDM, is part of the \Xyce{} 7.0 release. See the Sandia
\Xyce{} website for more information and downloads.

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item The BSIM-CMG version 108 has been added as MOSFET level 108.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The .OPTIONS LINSOL-AC option now allows AC analyses to
use any of the transient linear solver methods.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item \texttt{FREQ} is now supported as a ``special variable'' that denotes
  the current simulation frequency.  It works for global parameters and
  dependent device parameters.  It also works on \texttt{.PRINT} and
  \texttt{.FUNC} lines.
\item For compatibility with other circuit simulators, \texttt{.INCL}
  is now a synonym for the include (\texttt{.INC}) netlist command.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Important Announcements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The \Xyce{} project is no longer providing binaries for RHEL6.
\item The model interpolation technique described in the \Xyce{}
  Reference Guide in section 2.1.18 has been marked as deprecated, and
  will be removed in a future release of Xyce.
\item It has been determined that some distributions of Linux have
  broken builds of OpenMPI in their package repositories.  Building
  \Xyce{} from source code in parallel with these OpenMPI installs
  will result in a version of \Xyce{} that may crash on some problems.
  This is not a bug in \Xyce{}, but a packaging error of the OpenMPI
  package on those operating systems.  Please see commentary in the
  ``Known Defects'' section of these release notes under bug number
  ``967-SON''.
\item \Xyce{} has deprecated the default conversion of quoted-string file
  names to a table of x,y pairs of data.  The old convention of
  \texttt{PARAMETER="file.dat"} which worked in some model statements
  and in behavioral sources will now generate a warning in the \Xyce{}
  output.  The correct way to specify a file of data for a parameter
  is to use the new \texttt{tablefile} keyword as in
  \texttt{PARAMETER=tablefile("file.dat")}.  While this release of
  \Xyce{} will accept both the old and new syntax, the double quote
  technique will be removed in a future release, after which Xyce
  will only accept the syntax of
  \texttt{PARAMETER=tablefile("file.dat")}.  Additionally, a new
  syntax of \texttt{PARAMETER=string("string value")} has been
  introduced to specify parameters that are pure strings.  This will
  be deprecated in a future release and the simpler syntax of
  \texttt{PARAMETER="string value"} will be used to specify string
  valued parameters.
\item The ``Xygra'' device, which was written as a special-purpose
  coupling mechanism to ALEGRA but which has occasionally been used
  for other coupling problems, has been marked as deprecated.  The
  new, more flexible ``General External'' device was created to take
  its place, and has supplanted the use of Xygra in ALEGRA.  The Xygra
  device and the API that enables it may be removed without notice in
  a future release of \Xyce{}. If your code has been using the Xygra
  capability to couple to Xyce, you must replace your usage with the
  new capability.  The ``General External'' coupling mechanism is
  documented thoroughly in an application note available on the
  \Xyce{} web site.
