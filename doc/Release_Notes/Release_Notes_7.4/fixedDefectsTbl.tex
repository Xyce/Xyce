\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 204/Github issue 24}: Interlibrary dependency problems &
     For user-compiled and installed Xyce builds beginning with
     release 6.1 and up to release 7.3, Xyce created and installed
     multiple, interdependent libraries such as ``libxyce'',
     ``libADMS'' and ``libNeuronModels'', all of which had to be
     linked into any user code that used Xyce.  As of release 7.4,
     only libxyce is installed, and it contains all functions
     previously placed into the other libraries.  If you are building
     codes to be linked against Xyce libraries, you must simplify your
     link line to link in just ``-lxyce''.\\ \hline
