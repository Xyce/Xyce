\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 257}: Improve error handling for invalid
FREQ values on .FOUR lines and invalid AT values on FOUR measure
lines & If a \Xyce{} user entered an invalid \texttt{FREQ} value
on a \texttt{.FOUR} line or an invalid \texttt{AT} value on a
\texttt{FOUR} measure line then that would cause the simulation
to exit before all of the post-processing output files had been
made at the end of the transient simulation. \\ \hline

\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 243/Ghub issue 29}: I(*) not expanded in external output &
The design of the code that handled output wildcards involving
currents (including I(*), P(*), and W(*)) was such that wildcards
requested by external output interfaces through the library API would
not have currents provided unless a \texttt{.PRINT} line in the
netlist also requested that wildcard.  The handling of this feature
has been reworked so that wildcards in external output requests
function correctly irrespective of any \texttt{.PRINT} lines in the
netlist, and even if there are no \texttt{.PRINT} lines at
all.\\ \hline

\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 204/Github issue 24}: Interlibrary dependency problems &
For user-compiled and installed Xyce builds beginning with release 6.1
and up to release 7.3, Xyce created and installed multiple,
interdependent libraries such as ``libxyce'', ``libADMS'' and
``libNeuronModels'', all of which had to be linked into any user code
that used Xyce.  As of release 7.4, only libxyce is installed, and it
contains all functions previously placed into the other libraries.  If
you are building codes to be linked against Xyce libraries, you must
simplify your link line to link in just ``-lxyce''.\\ \hline

  \textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 204}: \texttt{.OPTIONS MEASURE MEASFAIL=1}
does not work properly for successful \texttt{TRIG-TARG} measures &
If \texttt{.OPTIONS MEASURE MEASFAIL=1} was used in a netlist then the
results for a successful \texttt{TRIG-TARG} measure would be correct
in the descriptive information sent to stdout.  However, the measure's
value would be shown as FAILED in the \texttt{<netlistName>.mt0}
file. \\ \hline

  \textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 229}: Parsing error when V() expression
contains extraneous trailing spaces & The new expression library did
not handle whitespace correctly, in certain contexts.  This has been
fixed in the expression lexer.  \\ \hline

  \textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 235}: Extend the R=0 capability to allow use
of resistor .MODELs & Resistors that have a resistance value of zero
are treated different inside of Xyce.  This different handling did not
allow for such resistors to refer to \texttt{.MODEL} statements.  That
has been fixed and now this use case works.  \\ \hline

  \textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 239}: \texttt{.options parser scale} doesn't
play nice with dependent parameters & If Xyce was used with a PDK that
used \texttt{.option scale} (or Xyce's version \texttt{.options parser
scale}), Xyce would apply this scale factor in the
Instance::processParams function of the relevant MOSFET devices.
However, if the device instance contained any dependent parameters,
then every time those parameters were updated, this function was
called again, and thus the scale factor was applied each time. This
resulted in the wrong L and W values.  This has been corrected and
scale factors are now applied no more than once.  \\ \hline

  \textbf{1322-SON}: Preserve ordering of .PRINT line wildcards &
In previous \Xyce{} versions, these two \texttt{.PRINT} lines would
both output the \texttt{V(*)} wildcard results before the \texttt{I(*)}
wildcard results.
\begin{verbatim}
.PRINT TRAN V(*) I(*)
.PRINT TRAN I(*) V(*)
\end{verbatim}
\\ \hline

  \textbf{1145-SON}: \texttt{.GLOBAL\_PARAM} does not work
in \texttt{.IC} statements & This has been resolved and global
parameters can be used to set the value of an \texttt{.IC}
statement.\\ \hline

  \textbf{1029-SON}: Improve checking of \texttt{.PRINT} type versus
analysis type & The checking of the \texttt{.PRINT} type versus the
analysis type had some deficiencies. It would falsely report an error
if a \texttt{.PRINT TRANADJOINT} line preceeded the \texttt{.PRINT
TRAN} line.  It could falsely not report an error if the \texttt{.OP}
statement preceeded the primary analysis statement (e.g.,
\texttt{.TRAN}), or if a valid \texttt{.PRINT} line was the first \texttt{.PRINT}
line in the netlist but a subsequent \texttt{.PRINT} line was not allowed
for the requested primary analysis type. \\ \hline
