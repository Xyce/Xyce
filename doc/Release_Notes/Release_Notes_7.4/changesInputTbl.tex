Change in output file names produced by \texttt{.FOUR} analyses &
Results from Fourier analyses are now output to \texttt{<netlistName>.four\#} files,
where the suffixed number (\texttt{\#}) starts at \texttt{0} and increases for multiple
iterations (\texttt{.STEP} iterations) of a given simulation. \\ \hline

Changes in the format of \texttt{.FFT} output sent to the
\texttt{<netlistName>.fft\#} files  & The output in those
files is no longer filtered based on the \texttt{FREQ}, \texttt{FMIN} and
\texttt{FMAX} values on each \texttt{.FFT} line.  Instead the data for
every harmonic is output.  The \texttt{START} and \texttt{STOP} values
used for each \texttt{.FFT} analysis are now output. \\ \hline

Additional \texttt{.FFT} output to stdout & If \texttt{.OPTION FFT FFTOUT}
is set to 1 then the additional metrics (ENOB, SFDR, SNR, SNDR and THD)
and a sorted list of the 30 largest harmonics, for each \texttt{.FFT} line,
are now output to stdout. \\ \hline

Changes to output file names produced by the -o command line option &
In prior releases, the -o filename only applied to the file name
produced by the primary \texttt{.PRINT} line.  The -o filename is now
used as the ``basename'' for all of the output files. As an example,
for a \texttt{.TRAN} analysis, this command line will now produce the
output file \verb+<results>.prn+, instead of the file \verb+<results>+,
from the \texttt{.PRINT} line.
\begin{vquote}
   Xyce -o results <netlistName>
\end{vquote}

The results from any \texttt{.MEASURE TRAN}, \texttt{.MEASURE TRAN\_CONT},
\texttt{.FFT} and/or \texttt{.FOUR} lines in the netlist will now be placed into
the files \verb+<results>.mt0+, \verb+<results>_measurename.mt0+,
\verb+<results>.fft0+, and \verb+<results>.four0+, respectively.  For a
\texttt{.STEP} analysis, the results file \verb+<results>.res+ will also be
made.
