\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{XDM}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item General:
  \begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Substitutions done by XDM for the special variable
    TEMP are no longer necessary and are taken out in this release.
  \end{XyceItemize}
\item HSPICE:
  \begin{XyceItemize}
  \item  Xyce's "-hspice-ext" option, which should be used
    when running HSPICE netlists translated by XDM, now by default
    expects the "." for the subcircuit hierarchy separator
    character. Therefore, XDM translations will leave that character
    unchanged rather than translating it to Xyce's native ":"
    subcircuit separator character.
  \item  Secondary sweep of .DC analyses should now be
    translated correctly into Xyce.
  \item  Xyce can now handle resistors with solution dependent
    expressions for their resistance values. Therefore, XDM will no
    longer translate solution dependent resistors into behavioral
    B-element sources.
  \end{XyceItemize}
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item The levels 1 and 2 diode now support a multiplicity factor.
    This is the ``M'' parameter on the instance line, not to be
    confused with the model parameter of the same name (the p-n
    junction grading parameter).
  \item The resistor model now supports solution-dependent
    expressions, so it is possible to have voltage-dependent resistors
    in Xyce netlists.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Voltage limiting in the BSIMSOI version 3 device model can now
    be optionally turned off, while leaving it turned on in other
    devices.  The implementation of voltage limiting in the BSIM SOI
    device is unorthodox and has been observed to cause robustness
    problems.  Turning it off can improve runtimes.
  \item Behavioral models have been optimized to eliminate redundant
    calls to the expression library.  For historical reasons, the Bsrc
    device was calling the expression library more than it needed to.
    This has been corrected, and it will improve the runtime of
    circuits with lots of behavioral models.  This same optimization
    has also been applied to other expression-dependent models, such
    as the capacitor and switch devices.
  \item The expression library has undergone several optimizations
    since the last code release.  These optimizations include a
    reduction in the number of necessary syntax tree traversals, a
    reduction in the memory footprint, reduction in dynamic memory
    allocations and deallocations, and many evaluation costs are now
    amortized in the expression setup.  For circuits with large
    numbers of expressions, these optimizations produce runtime
    performance improvements of netlist parsing and overall simulation
    speed.

\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item ``Continuous mode'' measures, that may return more than one
    result, are now supported for the \texttt{DERIV-AT},
    \texttt{DERIV-WHEN}, \texttt{FIND-AT}, \texttt{FIND-WHEN} and
    \texttt{WHEN} measure types for \texttt{.AC}, \texttt{.DC},
    \texttt{.NOISE} and \texttt{.TRAN} analyses.
  \item The \texttt{-remeasure} command line option now supports
    \Xyce{} output files made with \texttt{FORMAT=GNUPLOT}.
  \item The full range of negative values (-1,-2,-3,...) are now
    supported for the \texttt{RISE}, \texttt{FALL} and \texttt{CROSS}
    qualifiers for the \texttt{DERIV-WHEN}, \texttt{FIND-WHEN} and
    \texttt{WHEN} measure types.
  \item The \texttt{ERROR} measure type is now supported for
    \texttt{.AC} and \texttt{.NOISE} analyses.
  \item Additional window functions (\texttt{BARTLETTHANN},
    \texttt{BLACKMAN}, \texttt{NUTTALL}, \texttt{COSINE2},
    \texttt{COSINE4}, \texttt{HALFCYCLESINE}, \texttt{HALFCYCLESINE3}
    and \texttt{HALFCYCLESINE6}) have been added for \texttt{.FFT}
    lines.  In addtional, both ``symmetric'' and ''periodic'' versions
    are now supported for all window functions.
  \item \texttt{.OPTIONS FFT FFT\_MODE=<0|1>} now allows the \Xyce{}
    user to select whether the \Xyce{} \texttt{.FFT} processing and
    output is more compatible with HSPICE (0) or Spectre (1).  The
    default is HSPICE.
  \item The \texttt{BINSIZ} qualifier is now implemented in \Xyce{} for
    the \texttt{ENOB}, \texttt{SFDR} and \texttt{SNDR} measure types. It
    can be used to account for any ``broadening'' of the spectral energy
    in the first harmonic of the signal.
  \item \texttt{.STEP} analyses now support \texttt{.FOUR} analyses.
  \item A bug in the handling of wildcard current output was fixed and
    now these wildcards may be requested using the external output API
    irrespective of whether the netlist being run contains print lines
    outputting the same data.
  \item More complex \texttt{.PRINT} line wildcards, such as VR(X1*)
    and IR(B1?), are now supported for all voltage and current
    operators.  So, this feature now also supports the VR, VI, VM, VP,
    VDB, IR, II, IM, IP and IDB operators used for \texttt{.AC},
    \texttt{.HB} and \texttt{.NOISE} analysis.  It also now supports
    the lead current operators IB, IC, ID, IE, IG and IS.
  \item All valid \texttt{.PRINT} line wildcards are now supported for
    numerical lead-current designators, such as I1 and I2.  (Note: At
    present, those designators are only supported for the T and
    YGENEXT devices.)
  \item The use of a period as the subcircuit name separator is now
    supported as a user-specified option.  The default separator in
    \Xyce{} is still the colon.  Period separators are enabled by the
    \texttt{-hspice-ext} command line option, either using
    \texttt{all} or \texttt{separator} as the second argument.
  \item Inductance values, for coupled mutual inductors are now
    accessible in the netlist, for outputs and also parameter-centric
    analyses such as \texttt{.STEP} and \texttt{.SENS}.

\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Xyce/ADMS Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item An error in the generation of code for derivatives of the
    ``min'' function with probe-dependent arguments has been fixed.
    The error impacted several internal models that had been generated
    using ADMS, but has not led to significant differences in
    simulation results.  Minor differences in convergence behavior
    have been observed.
  \item Support for the atan2 function and generation of correct code
    for its derivatives has been added.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Important Announcements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The model interpolation technique described in the \Xyce{}
  Reference Guide in section 2.1.18 has been marked as deprecated, and
  will be removed in a future release of Xyce.
\item The link line required to link \Xyce{} libraries (installed by
  ``make install'') to user code has been simplified.  Now only
  ``-lxyce'' is needed, where in previous releases it was necessary to
  link in several related libraries.
\end{XyceItemize}
