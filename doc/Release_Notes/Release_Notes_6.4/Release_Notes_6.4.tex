\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

For up-to-date information not available at the time these notes were produced,
please visit the \XyceTM{} web page at
{\color{XyceDeepRed}\url{http://xyce.sandia.gov}}.

Highlights for the \XyceTM{} \XyceVersionVar{} Release include:
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item New devices, such as VBIC 1.3, MEXTRAM with self-heating, and the
    Yakopcic Memristor
  \item New Local truncation Error (LTE) criterions for time-step control
  \item Oversampling capability for Harmonic Balance time domain output
  \item Last release with full support for Red Hat Linux 5
\end{XyceItemize}

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item VBIC version 1.3, 3- and 4-terminal variants (Q levels 11 and 12)
  \item MEXTRAM 504.11 with self-heating (Q level 505)
  \item A new memristor device using the Yakopcic model
  \item Support for Reactive Power limits in the Power Grid Generator Bus
        model.
  \item Improved compatibility between \Xyce{} and PSpice Digital Behavioral
        models. 
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item The Kundert SPARSE linear solver has been added as a linear solver option in Xyce.  
  \item The netlist parser has been significantly refactored to reduce memory
        consumption and improve parsing speeds for large circuits.
  \item Improved Harmonic Balance (HB) robustness during the initial guess calculation.
  \item New Local truncation Error (LTE) criterions that use history information of signals improve time stepping for all time integrators.
  \item Oversampling capability for Harmonic Balance time domain output enables users to produce well-resolved time-domain outputs.
  \item Arclength continuation is now much more useful and robust.
  \item Sensitivity analysis can now allow multiple objective functions.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Power calculations supported for controlled-source devices (B,E,F,G and H).
  \item Support for additional .MEASURE statement syntaxes.
  \item New output options, that allow the user to suppress the header and
        footer of standard-format output files.
  \item Improved error handling during netlist parsing.
  \item Improved Harmonic Balance Output.
  \item New support for the DIGINITSTATE option, which sets the initial state of
        the Digital Flip-Flip and Latch devices.
\end{XyceItemize}

\section{Supported Platforms}
\subsection*{Certified Support}
The following platforms have been subject to certification testing for the
\Xyce{} version 6.4 release.
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Red Hat Enterprise Linux${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$ 5, x86 (serial only) and x86-64 (serial and parallel)
  \item Red Hat Enterprise Linux${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$ 6, x86-64 (serial and parallel)
  \item Microsoft Windows 7${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$, x86 (serial)
  \item Apple${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$ OS X Yosemite, x86-64 (serial and parallel)
\end{XyceItemize}
Note that this is the last release with Certified Support for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$ 5. In subsequent releases, RHEL5
will be in the ``Build Support'' category.

\subsection*{Build Support}
Though not certified platforms, \Xyce{} has been known to run on the following
systems.
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item FreeBSD 9.x and 10.x on Intel x86 and x86-64 architectures (serial and parallel)
  \item Distributions of Linux other than Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  \item Microsoft Windows under Cygwin and MinGW.
\end{XyceItemize}
