The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{Important Announcements}

Xyce is now supporting Red Hat Enterprise Linux${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$
(RHEL) 8, x86-64 (serial and parallel). Previous releases supported RHEL 7.

\subsubsection*{XDM}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item 
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}

\item The BSIM-CMG model version 111.2.1 has been added to \Xyce{} as a new MOSFET level 111.  Previous versions 107, 108 and 110 are still supported, for backward compatibility.

\item The voltage limiting in the BSIMSOI version 3 device model is
improved which can lead to both robustness and performance improvements.
The voltage limiting related calculations for body nodes were incorrect 
which led to robustness issues when body nodes (5th or 6th node) are
used (e.g., Sandia's CMOS PDK) and voltage limiting is activated during
simulation. Fixing voltage limiting improves both convergence
and runtime performance for these circuits.

\item The scaling of Gmin in the BSIMSOI version 3 device model can now
be optionally turned off which can improve circuit convergence. The Gmin
used in BSIMSOI version 3 model is scaled by 1e-6 which makes it much smaller than
Gmin used in other nonlinear devices. A small gmin value can cause circuit
convergence issue.

\item Many older hand-written devices now support the parameter \texttt{DTEMP}.  This 
parameter refers to a device instance temperature difference relative to the 
circuit temperature.  This is a compatibility enhancement.  Most of the newer devices,
which were generated from Verilog-A using ADMS, already supported \texttt{DTEMP}.  
The older devices that now support it include the resistor, capacitor, 
inductor, diode, levels 1,2,3,6 MOSFET, BSIM3, BSIM4, BSIMSOI version 3, level 1 BJT, 
JFET and MESFET.

\item User-defined netlist functions can now be specified as a special 
case of \texttt{.PARAM}.  For example, \texttt{.PARAM F(X)='X*2'} is now a 
valid \Xyce{} syntax.  Historically, functions in a \Xyce{} netlist had 
to be specified using the \texttt{.FUNC} keyword, so the example would have 
been specified as \texttt{.FUNC F(X) \{X*2\}}.
The parser now natively supports both specifications.   

\item The nonlinear voltage-controlled current source (VCCS) device now supports 
  the multiplier (\texttt{M=}) parameter.  Previously, this was only supported in linear 
  VCCS devices, as the nonlinear VCCS device is turned into a behavioral (B-source) 
  device internally.  Like with other model supporting the \texttt{M} parameter, this 
  parameter is implicitly connected to subcircuit multipliers.

\item The behavioral source model (B-source) now supports multiplier parameters, 
  for the current source (\texttt{I=}) configuration.  Like with other model 
  supporting the \texttt{M} parameter, this parameter is implicitly connected 
  to subcircuit multipliers.

\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}


\item The spice strategy, which is the default nonlinear solve method for DC 
calculations, has been improved. Previously, if spice strategy is used in
DC sweeps and one DC solve fails, the solutions after a failed DC can 
be incorrect. The robustness of spice strategy in Xyce is improved and it now
solves correct results after a failed DC in DC sweeps. 

\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The \texttt{DELIMITER} parameter on the \texttt{.PRINT} line has been expanded.  It previously only supported \texttt{TAB} and \texttt{COMMA}.  Now it also supports \texttt{SEMICOLON} and \texttt{COLON}.  It also will allow specifying quoted delimiter strings, such as \texttt{DELIMITER=";"}.  Previously this parameter only applied to the standard output format, but now it also applies to Comma-separated values (CSV) formatted output as well.  This was primarily added to address backlog issue 613 (see fixed defects table).
