\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{XDM}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item place holder
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item The L-UTSOI MOSFET model (level 10240 MOSFET) is now available
    under an open source license and the source code is now part of
    the main Xyce source code repository.  It had previously only been
    available in our ``non free'' binaries (``XyceNF'').
  \item The level 1 BJT now supports a multiplicity factor \texttt{M=}.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Source stepping, which is one of the solver techniques that
  \Xyce{} automatically attempts when trying to solve the DCOP, now
  includes current sources as well as voltage sources.  As a result
  circuits using current sources are much more robust for the DCOP
  calculation.
\item The new harmonics selection method based on box truncation has
  been added for HB analysis
\item Parameter handling for \texttt{.SAMPLING} and other UQ methods
  is now much more efficient (see issue 306 in the fixed defects
  table).
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item TRIG-TARG measures are now supported for .AC, .DC and .NOISE
    analyses.  In addition, the TRIG-TARG measure is now more
    compatible with both ngspice and HSPICE.  See gitlab-ex issues 220
    and 289 in the Fixed Defects Table for more details.
  \item ``Continuous mode'' measures that may return more than one
    result are now supported for the TRIG-TARG measure type for .AC,
    .DC, .NOISE and .TRAN analyses.
  \item The scale parameter, which is used to automatically scale
    device sizing parameters is supported and can be specified using
    either \texttt{.option scale=number} or \texttt{.options device
      scale=number}.
  \item Added the mixed signal interface function
    \texttt{Simulator::getTimeVoltagePairsSz} supplies the maximun
    number of time, voltage or state values for an ADC in a subsequent
    call to \texttt{Simulator:: getTimeVoltagePairs} or
    \texttt{Simulator::getTimeStatePairs}.
  \item Added the mixed signal interface functions
    \texttt{xyce\_getTimeVoltagePairs\-ADCLimitData()} and
    \texttt{xyce\-\_getTimeStatePairs\-ADCLimitData()} to allow the
    calling program to specify the maximum size of the allocated
    memory that can be used for copying ADC time-voltage and
    time-state history data.  This allows the caller to allocate only
    the required amount of memory and ensure that Xyce cannot
    overwrite the memory area.  The existing c-interface functions,
    \texttt{xyce\_getTimeVoltagePairs()} and
    \texttt{xyce\_getTimeStatePairs()} are now deprecated. They work
    in this version of \Xyce{} as they did in the past but they will
    be removed from a future version of \Xyce{}.  See the Application
    note, Mixed Signal Simulation with \Xyce{} 7.5 for further
    details.
  \item The Xyce Python interface file \texttt{xyce\-interface.py} is
    now compatible with Python 3.x.  The interface file is still
    backwards compatible with Python 2.7. The Mixed Signal Simulation
    with \Xyce{} 7.5 Application Note has examples of using Xyce from
    Python.
 \item The syntax for \texttt{.options parser scale} has been expanded
   to also support \texttt{.option scale}.  The new syntax is
   compatible with most other SPICE-style simulators.
 \item When a parameter of a given name is defined multiple times in
   the netlist, \Xyce{} now has several options for how this is
   handled.  Before, \Xyce{} would silently allow multiply-defined
   parameters, and use the last one encountered during parsing.  There
   is now a command line option (\texttt{-redefined\_params}), which
   can be used to make this a fatal error, or to use the first, rather
   than last multiply-defined parameter.
 \item When any measure fails, Xyce now reports ``FAILED'' in both the
   console output and ``.mt\#'' files by default.  This new behavior is
   the same as what Xyce 7.4 would have done with the ``.options
   MEASURE MEASFAIL=1'' option specified.  Previous versions of Xyce
   would have output ``-1'' for the failed measure in the ``.mt\#''
   file by default.  The old behavior may be forced by specifying
   ``.options MEASURE MEASFAIL=0 DEFAULT\_VAL=-1'' if desired.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Xyce/ADMS Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item place holder
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Important Announcements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The model interpolation technique described in the \Xyce{}
  Reference Guide in section 2.1.18 has been marked as deprecated, and
  will be removed in a future release of Xyce.
