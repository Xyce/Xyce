\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{XDM}
\begin{XyceItemize}
    \item Translations of netlists using binned models will no longer
      have the \texttt{.OPTION PARSER MODEL\_BINNING=TRUE}
      statement. This option is turned on by default in \Xyce{} now
      and therefore no longer needs to be explicitly declared.
    \item Duplicate output variables will now be removed from the
      \texttt{.PRINT} line.
    \item The expression and function pre-processing capabilities have
      been removed from XDM.
    \item [spectre] The \texttt{else} conditional block in
      \texttt{if-else} statments will now be commented out by XDM,
      since conditional statement support is not fully mature yet in
      \Xyce{}.
    \item [pspice] Fixed bug where instance parameters for temperature
      coefficients for resistors were not translated.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item The L-UTSOI MOSFET model (level 10240 MOSFET) is now available
    under an open source license and the source code is now part of
    the main Xyce source code repository.  It had previously only been
    available in our ``non free'' binaries (``XyceNF'').
  \item The level 1 BJT now supports a multiplicity factor \texttt{M=}.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Source stepping, which is one of the solver techniques that
  \Xyce{} automatically attempts when trying to solve the DCOP, now
  includes current sources as well as voltage sources.  As a result
  circuits using current sources are much more robust for the DCOP
  calculation.
\item The new harmonics selection method based on box truncation has
  been added for HB analysis
\item Parameter handling for \texttt{.SAMPLING} and other UQ methods
  is now much more efficient (see issue 306 in the fixed defects
  table).
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item TRIG-TARG measures are now supported for .AC, .DC and .NOISE
    analyses.  In addition, the TRIG-TARG measure is now more
    compatible with both ngspice and HSPICE.  See gitlab-ex issues 220
    and 289 in the Fixed Defects Table for more details.
  \item ``Continuous mode'' measures that may return more than one
    result are now supported for the TRIG-TARG measure type for .AC,
    .DC, .NOISE and .TRAN analyses.
  \item The scale parameter, which is used to automatically scale
    device sizing parameters is supported and can be specified using
    either \texttt{.option scale=number} or \texttt{.options device
      scale=number}.  The new syntax is
   compatible with most other SPICE-style simulators.
  \item Added the mixed signal interface function
    \texttt{Simulator::getTimeVoltagePairsSz} supplies the maximun
    number of time, voltage or state values for an ADC in a subsequent
    call to \texttt{Simulator:: getTimeVoltagePairs} or
    \texttt{Simulator::getTimeStatePairs}.
  \item Added the mixed signal interface functions
    \texttt{xyce\_getTimeVoltagePairs\-ADCLimitData()} and
    \texttt{xyce\-\_getTimeStatePairs\-ADCLimitData()} to allow the
    calling program to specify the maximum size of the allocated
    memory that can be used for copying ADC time-voltage and
    time-state history data.  This allows the caller to allocate only
    the required amount of memory and ensure that Xyce cannot
    overwrite the memory area.  The existing c-interface functions,
    \texttt{xyce\_getTimeVoltagePairs()} and
    \texttt{xyce\_getTimeStatePairs()} are now deprecated. They work
    in this version of \Xyce{} as they did in the past but they will
    be removed from a future version of \Xyce{}.  See the Application
    note, Mixed Signal Simulation with \Xyce{} 7.5 for further
    details.
  \item The Xyce Python interface file \texttt{xyce\-interface.py} is
    now compatible with Python 3.x.  The interface file is still
    backwards compatible with Python 2.7. The Mixed Signal Simulation
    with \Xyce{} 7.5 Application Note has examples of using Xyce from
    Python.
  \item Implicit multipliers on subcircuits (\texttt{M=}) are now supported.
  \item When a parameter of a given name is defined multiple times in
    the netlist, \Xyce{} now has several options for how this is
    handled.  Before, \Xyce{} would silently allow multiply-defined
    parameters, and use the last one encountered during parsing.  There
    is now a command line option (\texttt{-redefined\_params}), which
    can be used to make this a fatal error, or to use the first, rather
    than last multiply-defined parameter.
  \item Subcircuit instance parameters are now allowed to reference 
    other subcircuit instance parameters on the same line.
  \item When any measure fails, Xyce now reports ``FAILED'' in both the
    console output and ``.mt\#'' files by default.  This new behavior is
    the same as what Xyce 7.4 would have done with the ``.options
    MEASURE MEASFAIL=1'' option specified.  Previous versions of Xyce
    would have output ``-1'' for the failed measure in the ``.mt\#''
    file by default.  The old behavior may be forced by specifying
    ``.options MEASURE MEASFAIL=0 DEFAULT\_VAL=-1'' if desired.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Xyce/ADMS Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Several bugs were addressed and are listed in the fixed defects table.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Important Announcements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The model interpolation technique described in the \Xyce{}
  Reference Guide in section 2.1.18 has been marked as deprecated, and
  will be removed in a future release of Xyce.
\item \Xyce{} binary installers now contain all the files that would
  be installed by ``make install'' instead of just the Xyce binary.
  This includes Xyce headers and library files that would be used to
  link external codes to Xyce.  Use of the \Xyce{} executable itself
  is unchanged by this packaging update.  Use of these headers and
  libraries in user code requires that the user have the same
  compilers that the Xyce team used to build the binary, which may not
  be the case for all users.
