Continued support for FRAC\_MAX qualifier on TRIG-TARG measure lines &
For backwards compatibility with previous \Xyce{} versions for internal
users, \texttt{.OPTIONS MEASURE USE\_LTTM=<value>} has been added.  This
option defaults to 0, which uses the new version of the TRIG-TARG measure;
while setting it to 1 will use the old version of the TRIG-TARG measure
for all TRIG-TARG measures in the netlist.  If the FRAC\_MAX qualifier is
used on a TRIG-TARG line then \Xyce{} will automatically default to
\texttt{USE\_LTTM=1} for that particular measure line.  \\ \hline
