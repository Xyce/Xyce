Mixed Signal Interface behavior when a ``backwards or null time step'' is requested.  &
Previously, for the Mixed Signal Interface, if the \texttt{requestedUntilTime}
in a \texttt{simulateUntil()} call was less than the current simulation time
then the \Xyce{} simulation would run to completion.  If the \texttt{requestedUntilTime}
was equal to the current simulation time then the simulation would get stuck in a
``time-step too small'' error loop.  The interface change is that both of these
cases are now simulation errors that will cause the \Xyce{} simulation to abort.
\\ \hline

Removed support for RISE, CROSS and FALL qualifiers for DUTY measure & This change
makes all of the duty-cycle calculation measures (\texttt{DUTY}, \texttt{FREQ},
\texttt{OFF\_TIME} and \texttt{ON\_TIME)} have similar behavior.  The
\texttt{FROM}, \texttt{TO} and \texttt{TD} qualifiers are still supported
for all four measure types.
