Mixed Signal Interface behavior when a ``backwards time step'' is requested.  &
For the Mixed Signal Interface, if the \texttt{requestedUntilTime} in a
\texttt{simulateUntil()} call is less than the current simulation time then
the \Xyce{} simulation will run to completion.  The interface change is that
a warning message is now emitted for this case.
