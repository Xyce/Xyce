\begin{document}
\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{XDM}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item XDM works with Python 3.x
  \item Translation of HSPICE .DATA command has been added.
  \item Better translation of HSPICE .MEASURE commands when compatible with Xyce.
  \item The translation of P-elements from HSPICE to Xyce is more complete.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item The BSIM SOI version 4.6.1 has been added as the level 70
    MOSFET.  At this time the implementation is limited to the
    four-node version without exposed body nodes.  It has been
    observed that the gate capacitor model may have compatibility
    issues with PDKs that are expecting versions 4.5 or earlier.  For
    this reason the older BSIM-SOI 4.5.0 has also been added as the
    level 70450 MOSFET.
  \item The BSIM6 model now supports a multiplicity factor, M, on its
    instance line.
  \item Models derived from Verilog-A sources (PSP, MEXTRAM, BSIM6,
    BSIM-CMG, BSIM SOI 4.6.1, HICUM, MVS, and JUNCAP200) now support
    output variables such as transconductances, capacitances, and
    conductances.  A new table of available output variables and how
    to access them has been added to the Reference Guide section for
    each of these models.
  \item The L\_UTSOI MOSFET model version 102.4.0 has been added as
    the level 10240 MOSFET.  Due to licensing restrictions, this model is
    not available in open source builds or in source form.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item The AVG, DERIV, FIND-WHEN, INTEG, RMS and WHEN measure types are
now supported for .AC and .DC analyses.
  \item The ERR, ERR1, ERR2 and FIND-AT measure types are now supported
for all three measure modes (AC, DC and TRAN).
  \item For the Mixed Signal interface, methods were added to allow
the user to query for the names of all of the devices in the
netlist, and for the parameter values of any device in the netlist.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Important Announcements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The \Xyce{} project is no longer providing binaries for RHEL6.
\item The model interpolation technique described in the \Xyce{}
  Reference Guide in section 2.1.18 has been marked as deprecated, and
  will be removed in a future release of Xyce.
\item It has been determined that some distributions of Linux have
  broken builds of OpenMPI in their package repositories.  Building
  \Xyce{} from source code in parallel with these OpenMPI installs
  will result in a version of \Xyce{} that may crash on some problems.
  This is not a bug in \Xyce{}, but a packaging error of the OpenMPI
  package on those operating systems.  Please see commentary in the
  ``Known Defects'' section of these release notes under bug number
  ``967-SON''.
\item \Xyce{} has deprecated the default conversion of quoted-string file
  names to a table of x,y pairs of data.  The old convention of
  \texttt{PARAMETER="file.dat"} which worked in some model statements
  and in behavioral sources will now generate a warning in the \Xyce{}
  output.  The correct way to specify a file of data for a parameter
  is to use the new \texttt{tablefile} keyword as in
  \texttt{PARAMETER=tablefile("file.dat")}.  While this release of
  \Xyce{} will accept both the old and new syntax, the double quote
  technique will be removed in a future release, after which Xyce
  will only accept the syntax of
  \texttt{PARAMETER=tablefile("file.dat")}.  Additionally, a new
  syntax of \texttt{PARAMETER=string("string value")} has been
  introduced to specify parameters that are pure strings.  This will
  be deprecated in a future release and the simpler syntax of
  \texttt{PARAMETER="string value"} will be used to specify string
  valued parameters.
\item The ``Xygra'' device, which was written as a special-purpose
  coupling mechanism to ALEGRA but which has occasionally been used
  for other coupling problems, has been marked as deprecated.  The
  new, more flexible ``General External'' device was created to take
  its place, and has supplanted the use of Xygra in ALEGRA.  The Xygra
  device and the API that enables it may be removed without notice in
  a future release of \Xyce{}. If your code has been using the Xygra
  capability to couple to Xyce, you must replace your usage with the
  new capability.  The ``General External'' coupling mechanism is
  documented thoroughly in an application note available on the
  \Xyce{} web site.
