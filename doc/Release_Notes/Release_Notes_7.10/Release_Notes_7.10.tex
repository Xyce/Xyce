The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The \texttt{TABLE} expression feature now allows the data to be specified out of order.  The expression code in \Xyce{} will now automatically sort tabular data.  This works for all of the interpolation features, such as \texttt{SPLINE} and \texttt{AKIMA}.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Important Announcements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Xyce has deprecated the autotools configuration and build system for release 7.10.  
  Support for autotools will be removed and the CMake configuration and build system will be the default for release 7.11.  
  This change is to facilitate planned integrations with new features and capabilities from Trilinos that are not available in the older autotools compliant versions.  
  This notice is only relevant for users that build Xyce from source code.
  Please consult the CMake building guide for updated information: \newline
