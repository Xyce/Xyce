\begin{document}
\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item An exponential temperature coefficient (TCE) was added to
  the resistor device.
\item The lossy and lossless transmission lines (O and T devices) now
  work in harmonic balance analysis (see bug 970-SON in the Known
  Defects table for more detail).
\item The BSIM-CMG version 110 (MOSFET level 110) has been extensively
  optimized and now runs much faster than it did in previous releases.
  The original, unoptimized version remains available as MOSFET level
  1110.  The original version will be kept in \Xyce{} for several
  releases, but will be removed eventually.
\item The 3-terminal version of VBIC 1.3 (BJT level 11) has been
  extensively optimized and now runs much faster than it did in
  previous releases.  The original, unoptimized version remains
  available as BJT level 111.  The original version will be kept in
  \Xyce{} for several releases, but will be removed eventually.
\item The VBIC version 1.2 (BJT level 10) is deprecated and {\em will
  be removed\/} in the next version of Xyce.  Users of VBIC are
  strongly advised to begin using the VBIC 1.3 3T device instead.
  Not only is VBIC 1.2 less numerically robust than VBIC 1.3, it is
  unsupported and the performance optimizations that have been
  applied to VBIC 1.3 will not be performed on VBIC 1.2.  See the
  \Xyce{} Reference Guide for details on how VBIC 1.2 netlists may
  be converted to use VBIC 1.3 instead.
\item The HICUM L2 model has been updated to the latest version (2.4.0).
\item A long-standing bug in applying capacitor initial conditions in
  one specific use case has been fixed.  This bug was present only when
  \texttt{IC=} was specified on the instance line of a capacitor and either
  \texttt{NOOP} or \texttt{UIC} was used on a \texttt{.TRAN} line to
  skip the operating point computation of a transient.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Improved robustness for HB analysis when the TAHB option is turned off.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Sampling methods (Monte Carlo and Latin Hypercube Sampling) are
  now supported in Xyce, using the \texttt{.SAMPLING} command to
  specify sampling options, and \texttt{.MEASURE} for statistical
  outputs.
\item Sweep loops can now be specified using the HSpice-style
  \texttt{.DATA} command.  This capability has been applied to
  \texttt{.STEP}, \texttt{.DC} and \texttt{.AC} analysis.  This allows
  the user to specify parameter loops in which multiple parameters are
  changed simultaneously.
\item \texttt{.AC} analysis can now sweep magnitude and phase at the
  same time as frequency.  Previously, \texttt{.AC} was restricted to
  only sweeping frequency.
\item For linear circuits, \texttt{.AC} analysis can now also sweep
  device parameters at the same time as frequency, magnitude and
  phase.
\item For sensitivity analysis, \texttt{.PARAM},
  \texttt{.GLOBAL\_PARAM} and \texttt{.FUNC} now work inside of
  objective functions.
\item Model binning based on length and width parameters is now
  supported for MOSFET devices.
\item A new ``general external interface'' API has been added to provide a
  general mechanism for coupling an external simulator to \Xyce{}.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Important Announcements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item It has been determined that some distributions of Linux have
  broken builds of OpenMPI in their package repositories.  Building
  \Xyce{} from source code in parallel with these OpenMPI installs
  will result in a version of \Xyce{} that may crash on some problems.
  This is not a bug in \Xyce{}, but a packaging error of the OpenMPI
  package on those operating systems.  Please see commentary in the
  ``Known Defects'' section of these release notes under bug number
  ``967-SON''.
\item Xyce has deprecated the default conversion of quoted-string file
  names to a table of x,y pairs of data.  The old convention of
  \texttt{PARAMETER="file.dat"} which worked in some model statements
  and in behavioral sources will now generate a warning in the \Xyce{}
  output.  The correct way to specify a file of data for a paramater
  is to use the new \texttt{tablefile} keyword as in
  \texttt{PARAMETER=tablefile("file.dat")}.  While this release of
  \Xyce{} will accept both the old and new syntax, a future release
  will only accept the syntax of
  \texttt{PARAMETER=tablefile("file.dat")}.  Additionally, a new
  syntax of \texttt{PARAMETER=string("string value")} has been
  introduced to specify parameters that are pure strings.  This will
  be deprecated in the next release and the simpler syntax of
  \texttt{PARAMETER="string value"} will be used to specify string
  valued parameters.
