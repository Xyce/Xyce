\section{Scope/Product Definition}

The \Xyce{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support, in a
rigorous manner, the simulation needs of the Sandia National Laboratories
electrical designers.  Specific requirements include, among others, the
ability to solve extremely large circuit problems by supporting large-scale
parallel computing platforms, improved numerical performance and
object-oriented code design and implementation.

The \Xyce{} release notes describe:
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item New features and enhancements
  \item Any defects fixed since the last release
  \item Current known defects and defect workarounds
  \item Incompatibilities With Other Circuit Simulators
  \item Hardware and software requirements
\end{XyceItemize}

For up-to-date information not available at the time these notes 
were produced, please visit the \Xyce{} web page at

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

Highlights for \Xyce{} Release 6.3 include:
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item New devices (MEXTRAM version 504, BSIM 6.1.0 and TEAM Memristor added).
\item DC operating point strategy now applies source-stepping if other attempts fail.
\item New devices (Branch, Bus shunt, Transformer and Generator Bus) 
  for modeling steady-state power flow in electric power grids.
\item ADMS back-end enhanced to generate code for analytic sensitivity derivatives. 
\item Support for measure statements when {\texttt .STEP} is used.
\item The ability to re-measure existing data in {\texttt .PRN} files.
\item New multi-tone Harmonic Balance (HB) analysis.
\item Small signal noise analysis (\texttt{.NOISE}).
  
\end{XyceItemize}
For details of each of these new features, see the \Xyce{} Users' Guide, the
\Xyce{} Installation Guide, and the \Xyce{} Reference Guide.  A more complete
listing of new features and improvements is given in the following sections.

\subsection{Robustness Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item DC operating point solution strategy now includes SPICE-like source stepping if Newton or GMIN stepping fail.
\item Extensive bug fixes and usability improvements for {\texttt .MEASURE}.  This includes
user-configurable output precision, and more informative output to standard output 
and log files.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsection{New Devices}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item BSIM6 version 6.1.0
\item MEXTRAM version 504.11.0
\item TEAM Memristor
\item Power Grid Branch, Bus Shunt, Transformer and Generator Bus
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsection{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item   Analytic derivatives are now computed for all ADMS-generated devices (VBIC, FBH HBT, MEXTRAM, BSIM6, BSIMCMG, PSP, EKV).  Sensitivities computed for these devices will be more accurate than the finite-difference method used prior to this implementation.
\item   ADMS back-end improved to more correctly support Verilog-A ternary operators.

\section{Hardware/Software}
This section gives basic information on supported platforms and hardware
and software requirements for running \Xyce{} 6.3.

\subsection{Supported Platforms (Certified Support)}
\Xyce\ 6.3 currently supports any of the following operating system platforms
(all versions imply the earliest supported---\Xyce{} generally works on later
versions as well).  These platforms are supported in the sense that they have
been subject to certification testing for the \Xyce{} version 6.3 release.  

\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Red Hat Enterprise Linux${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$ 5, x86 (serial only) and x86-64 (serial and parallel)
\item Red Hat Enterprise Linux${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$ 6, x86-64 (serial and parallel)
\item Microsoft Windows 7${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$, x86 (serial)
\item Apple${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$ OS X, x86-64 (serial and parallel)
\item TLCC (serial and parallel)
\item Red Sky (serial and parallel)
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsection{Build Supported Platforms (not Certified)}
The platforms listed in this section are ``not supported'' in the
sense that they are not subject to nightly regression testing, and
they also were not subject to certification testing for the \Xyce{}
version 6.3 release.  Despite this lack of testing rigor, \Xyce{} has
been known to run under these configurations.

\begin{XyceItemize}
\item FreeBSD 9.x and 10.x on Intel x86 and x86-64 architectures (serial and parallel)
\item Distributions of Linux other than Red Hat Enterprise Linux
\item Microsoft Windows under Cygwin and MinGW.
\end{XyceItemize}

Please contact the Xyce development team for platform and configuration availability.

\subsection{Hardware Requirements}

The \Xyce{} team has not determined a minimum memory or processor
speed requirement.  Any modern computer should have enough memory and
processor power to run moderately sized circuits in serial with
\Xyce{}.  Naturally, memory requirements grow with problem size.  

Running \Xyce{} in parallel will require a system with at least two
processors. For problems of the size where parallel operation is
beneficial (thousands of devices per processor), one can expect to
need several gigabytes of memory per processor. 

For the very largest problems that \Xyce{} can run (millions of
devices), one will require a cluster system with a sufficient number
of nodes to distribute the problem efficiently, and sufficient memory
per node to support the distributed problem.  

\subsection{Software Requirements}
Several libraries are required to run \Xyce{} or build \Xyce{} from source on a
platform.  Serial versions of the \Xyce{} binary have no run-time software
requirements, as they ship with all the shared libraries they need.  However,
parallel versions require Open MPI
({\color{XyceDeepRed}\url{http://www.open-mpi.org/}}) (version 1.4 or higher)
at run time.  TLCC and Red Sky users can load the \textbf{xyce} module to properly
set the environment. 

Several libraries (all freely available from Sandia National
Laboratories or other sites) are always required when building \Xyce{}
from source.  A complete list of these required libraries is available
in the building guide on the \Xyce{} web site.
