\begin{document}
\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item All Verilog-A-derived models now support lead currents.  In addition, all two-terminal, BJT, and MOSFET devices derived from Verilog-A support power output:
  \begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Diodes: JUNCAP200
  \item BJTs: VBIC, MEXTRAM, FBH HBT
  \item MOSFETs: PSP, BSIM6, BSIMCMG, MVS, EKV
  \end{XyceItemize}
  \item THE VBIC 1.2 (Level=10) MODEL IS NOW DEPRECATED.  It will be removed in version 6.7 of \Xyce{}.  The VBIC 1.3 model (levels 11 and 12) will be the only supported VBIC model in version 6.7 of \Xyce{}.  Please update any netlists you have that use the level=10 model to use one of these VBIC 1.3 models instead.
  \item Power output is now supported for the lossless transmission line (T device), Voltage-Controlled 
  Switch (S device), Current-Controlled Switch (W device), Generic Switch (SW device), JFET (Levels 1 and 2),
  MOSFET (Levels 1,2,3,6,9,10,14 and 18) and MESFET.
  \item The PSP MOSFET has been updated to version 103.4.  Prior versions of \Xyce{} had version 103.1.
  \item The BSIM6 MOSFET has been updated to version 6.1.1.  Prior versions of \Xyce{} had version 6.1.0.
  \item The MEXTRAM BJT has been updated to version 504.12.1.  Prior versions of \Xyce{} had version 504.11.0.
  \item The Xyce/ADMS Verilog compiler back-end can now produce correct code for models that collapse internal nodes to ground based on model parameter values.
  \item The legacy version (102.5) of the PSP MOSFET has been added to \Xyce{} as a new MOSFET level 102.  This version is provided for compatibility with foundry model cards, as the PSP 103 versions are not backward compatible with the 102 versions.
  \item The BSIM-CMG model version 110.0.0 has been added to \Xyce{} as a new MOSFET level 110.  Because this is a major version number update, the older BSIM-CMG model version 107.0.0 has been retained as the level 107 MOSFET.
  \item The Toggle Flip-Flop (TFF) and JK Flip-Flop (JKFF) were added as Behavioral Digital Devices.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Improved performance of device evaluation and loading through the separation of device types.
  \item Improved performance and scalability of parallel netlist parsing and device distribution.
  \item Improved robustness of the internal KSparse solver by employing KLU for numeric factorization failures.  
  \item NOTE: THE BDF TIME INTEGRATION METHOD (METHOD=BDF or METHOD=6) IS NOW DEPRECATED. It will be removed in version 6.7 of \Xyce{}. The Trapezoid (METHOD=TRAP or METHOD=7) and Gear (METHOD=GEAR or METHOD=8) methods will be the only supported time integration methods in version 6.7. Please update any netlists you have that explicitly use the BDF time integration method to use the Gear method instead. If this results in convergence or accuracy issues, please contact the \Xyce{} Development Team as soon as possible.
  \item A new time step error-control method (\texttt{MASKIVARS} option), based on types of circuit variables.
  \item Improved performance and accuracy of transient adjoint sensitivity analysis.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Remeasure now supports \texttt{.CSV} files and comma-delimited \texttt{.PRN} files.
  \item New \texttt{ERROR} measure calculates the norm between the measured waveform and 
     a ``comparison waveform'' specified in a file.  The supported norms are L1, L2 and INFNORM.
\end{XyceItemize}

\section{Supported Platforms}
\subsection*{Certified Support}
The following platforms have been subject to certification testing for the
\Xyce{} version 6.6 release.
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Red Hat Enterprise Linux${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$ 6, x86-64 (serial and parallel)
  \item Microsoft Windows 7${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$, x86 (serial)
  \item Apple${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$ OS X Yosemite, x86-64 (serial and parallel)
\end{XyceItemize}
Note that the \Xyce{} team has dropped Certified Support for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux${}^{\mbox{\textregistered}}$ 5. RHEL5 is now in the
``Build Support'' category.

\subsection*{Build Support}
Though not certified platforms, \Xyce{} has been known to run on the following
systems.
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item FreeBSD 9.x and 10.x on Intel x86 and x86-64 architectures (serial and parallel)
  \item Distributions of Linux other than Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
  \item Microsoft Windows under Cygwin and MinGW.
\end{XyceItemize}
