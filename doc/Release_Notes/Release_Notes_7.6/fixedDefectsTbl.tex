\textbf{Xyce Backlog Bugs/1}: Mutual inductor jacobian error &
A jacobian term in the nonlinear mutual inductor was wrong when the bias was changing 
across the primary inductor.  This jacobian error could lead to slower nonlinear 
convergence in transient simulations.  It has been fixed. \\ \hline

\textbf{Xyce Backlog Bugs/2}: Mutual inductors have a bad device connectivity map &
>>>>>>> 38619b588 (Document fix of the CMake version reporting)
The device connectivity map is used to determine the path to ground for error checking.  
The linear and nonlinear mutual inductors were not correctly setting up 
the device connectivity map and this resulted in false warnings that some circuit 
nodes did not have a path to ground.  The warning was invalid and this issue did 
not effect Xyce's calculations.  But the warning was incorrect and could cause 
confusion.  The code has been fixed and this warning should no longer appear under
false conditions. \\ \hline

\textbf{Xyce Project Backlog/260}: Fix version string in CMake development builds &
Xyce reports its version using \texttt{Xyce -v}.  With development versions of
Xyce, the reported version should include the Git SHA against which the code
was compiled along with the time of compilation. Prior to this change, CMake
would include the SHA and time at \emph{configure} time, not compilation time.
That is now fixed. \\ \hline
