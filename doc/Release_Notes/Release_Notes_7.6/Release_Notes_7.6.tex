\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{XDM}
\begin{XyceItemize}
    \item Placeholder
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The voltage-controlled current source (VCCS, or '\texttt{G}'
    device) now supports the \texttt{M} multiplier parameter.
\item The BSIM4 device (level 14 and 54 MOSFET) now supports three
  versions, the 4.6.1 version that has been present for many releases
  and the 4.7.0 and 4.8.2 versions new to this release.  The specific
  version of BSIM4 can be selected by setting the \texttt{VERSION}
  parameter on the \texttt{.MODEL} line for the device.  At this time
  the BSIM4 is the only device in Xyce that supports multiple versions
  in this manner.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The new harmonics selection method based on diamond truncation has
  been added for HB analysis
\item Improvements to the parser have been made to address significant
  slowdowns in processing the open source SkyWater 130nm PDK.  For
  exemplar stress tests, parsing is now up to 20x faster.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The number of warnings output by Xyce can now be controlled by
  the command-line option ``-max-warnings \#''.  The default maximum
  number of warnings is now 100, before it was unlimited.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Important Announcements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The model interpolation technique described in the \Xyce{}
  Reference Guide in section 2.1.18 has been marked as deprecated, and
  will be removed in a future release of Xyce.
\end{XyceItemize}
