\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{XDM}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item place holder
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Support for BSIM-SOI 4.6.1 and 4.5.0 has been improved.  \Xyce{}
    now allows some configurations of the 5-, 6-, and 7- node variants
    of the model in addition to the 4-node provided by \Xyce{} 7.1.
  \item The BSIM6 model now supports an optional fifth node, allowing
    netlist access to the temperature rise due to self-heating.
  \item \Xyce{} now supports the DIODE\_CMC model as the level 2002 diode.
  \item The lossless transmission line no longer forces a maximum
    timestep on the time integrator.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The expression library in \Xyce{} has been completely rewritten and replaced.  This new library is much more efficient for expressions found in modern process design kits (PDKs).  
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item .MEASURE is now supported for .NOISE analyses.
  \item The RISE, FALL and CROSS qualifiers are now supported for
    DERIV-WHEN, FIND-WHEN and WHEN measures for .AC, .DC and .NOISE analyses.
  \item The DNI and DNO operators can print out the individual input and
    output noise contributions for each noise source within a device.
  \item The -noise\_names\_file command line option can generate a
    listing of the noise source names for each device in a netlist.
  \item The P(*) and W(*) wildcards are now supported on .PRINT lines
    for TRAN and DC analysis modes.
  \item The I(*) wildcard is now supported on .PRINT lines for lead
    currents, for most Xyce devices, for TRAN and DC analysis modes.
    However, for multi-terminal devices, such as J, M, Q and Z,
    explict lead current designators (e.g, IC(*) for Q devices) must
    be used instead.
  \item The VR(*), VI(*), VP(*), VM(*), VDB(*), IR(*), II(*), IP(*),
    IM(*) and IDB(*) wildcards are now supported on .PRINT lines
    for branch currents for AC and NOISE analysis modes.
  \item There is now limited support for more complex wildcards,
    such as V(X1*), I(X1*), P(X1*) and W(X1*), on .PRINT lines.
  \item The new expression library (mentioned above) now fully supports complex numbers.
  \item The new expression library can now connect random operators such as AGAUSS to .SAMPLING analysis.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Xyce/ADMS Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Support for \$port\_connected has been added to enable
    designation of optional nodes.
  \item Support for \$bound\_step, enabling a device to impose a
    maximum step size on the simulation, has been added.  This feature
    is primarily useful only for devices that act like independent
    sources.
  \item The deprecated, ``legacy'' Xyce/ADMS back-end that generated
    code that used Sacado for differentiation has been completely
    removed.
  \item The logic related to ddx() handling has been improved so that
    Xyce/ADMS is no longer emitting second derivative code when those
    derivatives are not needed.  This results in dramatically improved
    compilation time of Verilog-A derived models.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Important Announcements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The model interpolation technique described in the \Xyce{}
  Reference Guide in section 2.1.18 has been marked as deprecated, and
  will be removed in a future release of Xyce.
\item It has been determined that some distributions of Linux have
  broken builds of OpenMPI in their package repositories.  Building
  \Xyce{} from source code in parallel with these OpenMPI installs
  will result in a version of \Xyce{} that may crash on some problems.
  This is not a bug in \Xyce{}, but a packaging error of the OpenMPI
  package on those operating systems.  Please see commentary in the
  ``Known Defects'' section of these release notes under bug number
  ``967-SON''.
\item \Xyce{} has deprecated the default conversion of quoted-string file
  names to a table of x,y pairs of data.  The old convention of
  \texttt{PARAMETER="file.dat"} which worked in some model statements
  and in behavioral sources will now generate a warning in the \Xyce{}
  output.  The correct way to specify a file of data for a parameter
  is to use the new \texttt{tablefile} keyword as in
  \texttt{PARAMETER=tablefile("file.dat")}.  While this release of
  \Xyce{} will accept both the old and new syntax, the double quote
  technique will be removed in a future release, after which Xyce
  will only accept the syntax of
  \texttt{PARAMETER=tablefile("file.dat")}.  Additionally, a new
  syntax of \texttt{PARAMETER=string("string value")} has been
  introduced to specify parameters that are pure strings.  This will
  be deprecated in a future release and the simpler syntax of
  \texttt{PARAMETER="string value"} will be used to specify string
  valued parameters.
\item The ``Xygra'' device, which was written as a special-purpose
  coupling mechanism to ALEGRA but which has occasionally been used
  for other coupling problems, has been removed.  The new, more
  flexible ``General External'' device was created to take its place,
  and has supplanted the use of Xygra in ALEGRA.  If your code has
  been using the Xygra capability to couple to Xyce, you must replace
  your usage with the new capability.  The ``General External''
  coupling mechanism is documented thoroughly in an application note
  available on the \Xyce{} web site.
