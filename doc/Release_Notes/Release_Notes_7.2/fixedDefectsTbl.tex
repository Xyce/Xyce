\textbf{1306-SON}: Fix FROM and TO qualifiers for DC mode measures &
The \texttt{FROM} and \texttt{TO} qualifiers would work correctly if
either both were used on a \texttt{.MEASURE DC} line, or if neither
was used.  Measures such as these now also work correctly for all
supported DC measure types:
\begin{verbatim}
.measure dc maxFrom max v(1) FROM=4
.measure dc minTo min v(1) TO=4
\end{verbatim}
\\ \hline

\textbf{1303-SON}: Segfault in mixed signal interface &
The Python method \texttt{getDeviceNames()}, and the underlying
\texttt{xyce\_getDeviceNames()} method in the mixed signal interface,
would segfault if invoked for some model groups (e.g, D, L and M) when
there were no devices from that model group in the \Xyce{} netlist.
