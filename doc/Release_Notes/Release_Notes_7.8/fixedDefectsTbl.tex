  \textbf{Xyce Project Backlog/xxx}: Desciption
  &  Details
  \\\hline

\textbf{Xyce Backlog Bugs/64}: LTRA device does not properly initialize history vector when UIC/NOOP is used &
  The lossy transmission line device (LTRA) was not bein intialized correctly,
  for transient simulations that skipped the DCOP calculation.  As a result,
  transient simulations using this device would crash if the netlist contained
  a \texttt{UIC} or \texttt{NOOP} keyword on the \texttt{.TRAN} line.  This has
  been fixed.  \\ \hline

  \textbf{Xyce Project Backlog/571}: Modify \Xyce{} parser so that it can
  handle multiple \texttt{.options} statements for the same component (for
  example, support \texttt{.options timeint} statements) &
  Most SPICE-style simulators use the \texttt{.option} (non-plural) command,
  and allow the netlist to have multiple \texttt{.option} comamnds.   \Xyce{}
  historically was different in two respects.  One difference is that \Xyce{}
  uses a plural \texttt{.options} command, and another difference is a required
  keyword to identify the part of the code to which the block of options is
  applied.  Also, finally, \Xyce{} was designed to only have a single
  \texttt{.options} statement of each type.  So, for example, at most one
  \texttt{.options device} statement, at most one \texttt{.options timeint}
  statement, etc.  Unforutunately, recent versions of \Xyce{} silently accepted
  multiple \texttt{.options} statements, and behaved differently depending on
  the keyword.  For example, if the netlist contained multiple \texttt{.options
  timeint} statements, \Xyce{} would only use one of them and silently ignore
  the others.  In contrast, if the netlist contained multiple \texttt{.options
  device} statements, it would use them all, but would ignore duplicate
  parameters.  This was confusing for users of other simulators, and has been
  fixed.  \Xyce{} now treats multiple statements as a combined single
  statement, and issues warnings for duplicate parameters.
  \\\hline
 
 \textbf{Xyce Project Backlog/609}: 
  Global parameters that are applied to subcircuit instance parameters don't work in parallel & 
  If a subcircuit instance parameter (on the \texttt{X} line) depended on a
  \texttt{.param} or \texttt{.global\_param}, and that parameter was a
  variable, this dependency worked in serial, but not parallel.  In this case,
  ``variable'' means parameters that are allowed to change as part of a
  \texttt{.STEP} sweep, or as part of a sampling method.  This was related to
  the order of operations in the parser.  This has been fixed.  \\ \hline

 \textbf{Xyce Project Backlog/631}: 
  Expression-based local variation doesn't always work with subcircuit arguments & 
  When expression-based local variation was applied to a subcircuit argument, it 
  was handled incorrectly.  This meant that subcircuit arguments that should have 
  had a random distribution were fixed to the mean value during sampling.  
  This has been fixed.  \\ \hline

  \textbf{Xyce Project Backlog/637}: Support shared library build of \Xyce{} under Windows.
  &  Modify the cmake build system to support building a shared library version
  of xyce, \texttt{xyce-share.dll}, so that Xyce functionality can be accessed
  as a library from other applications.  \\\hline
