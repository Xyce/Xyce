The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{XDM}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item XDM did not change in this release, so new installers were not generated.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The PSP103 model has been modified so that the DTA parameter can be
     specified on the instance line.  Previously it was exclusively a model
     parameter.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item  \Xyce{} can now handle the sources that involve transient specifications
     during source stepping. Source stepping is one of the solver techniques
     that \Xyce{} automatically attempts when trying to solve the DC operating
     point (DCOP). Previously, source stepping would only apply to DC sources
     that had no transient specifications. It now applies to sources that
     involve transient specifications, with or without DC specifications. When
     a source has inconsistent DC and transient specifications, the value used
     in the source stepping depends on the analysis type. See the \Xyce{} Users
     Guide for details. This leads to improved robustness and convergence of
     source stepping in circuits using these sources for the DCOP calculation.

\item \Xyce{} now provides a sequential source stepping algorithm that will
     ramp up sources with non-zero DC value in sequence, which can be more
     robust than the default simultaneous source stepping algorithm.  This new
     source stepping approach can be called directly using \texttt{.options
     nonlin continuation=35} or \texttt{.options nonlin
     continuation=sourcestep2}.  It will not replace simultaneous source
     stepping in the default DCOP strategy at this time.

\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item \Xyce{} can now handle multiple \texttt{.OPTIONS} statements for the same
     keyword.   So, for example, if the netlist contains more than one
     \texttt{.OPTIONS TIMEINT} command, \Xyce{} will combine all the statements
     into a single, combined \texttt{.OPTIONS TIMEINT} statement.  Previously,
     Xyce's behavior in this respect was undefined.  For example, if the
     netlist contained multiple \texttt{.options timeint} statements, \Xyce{}
     would only use one of them and silently ignore the others.  \Xyce{} now
     treats multiple statements as a combined single statement, consistent with
     other simulators, and issues warnings for duplicate parameters.

\item The \texttt{.GLOBAL} statement now supports multiple global nodes on the
     same line.  Previously each specified node needed its own unique
     \texttt{.GLOBAL} statement.

\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Important Announcements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The model interpolation technique previously described in the \Xyce{}
  Reference Guide has been removed from Xyce.
