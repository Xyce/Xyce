\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item Xyce now ...

\item  \Xyce{} can now handle the sources that involve transient specifications during source stepping. Source stepping is one of the solver techniques that \Xyce{} automatically attempts when trying to solve the DC operating point (DCOP). Previously, source stepping can only apply to DC sources that have no transient specifications. It now applies to sources that involve transient specifications with or without DC specifications. When a source has inconsistent DC and transient specifications, the value used in the source stepping depends on the analysis type. See \Xyce{} Users guide for details. This leads to improved robustness and convergence of source stepping in circuits using these sources for the DCOP calculation.

\item \Xyce{} now provides a sequential source stepping algorithm that will ramp up non-zero DC sources in sequence, which can be more robust than the default simultaneous source stepping algorithm.  This new source stepping approach can be called directly using \texttt{.options nonlin continuation=35} or \texttt{.options nonlin continuation=sourcestep2}.  It will not replace simultaneous source stepping in the default DCOP strategy at this time.

\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item \Xyce{} can now handle multiple \texttt{.OPTIONS} statements for the same keyword.   So, for example, if the netlist contains more than one \texttt{.OPTIONS TIMEINT} commands, \Xyce{} will combine all these statements internally into a single combined \texttt{.OPTIONS TIMEINT} statement.  Previously, Xyce's behavior in this respect was undefined.  For example, if the netlist contained multiple \texttt{.options timeint} statements, \Xyce{} would only use one of them and silently ignore the others.  This was confusing for users of other simulators, and has been fixed.  \Xyce{} now treats multiple statements as a combined single statement, and issues warnings for duplicate parameters.
