\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{XDM}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item place holder
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item The lossless transmission line history interpolation has been
    improved to better capture discontinuous signals such as those
    produced by pulsed voltage sources.  Various issues related to
    discontinuity detection and breakpointing were also fixed in this
    release.
  \item An ideal delay device has been added.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Increased parallel stability and robustness for simulation algorithms and models
        on increasing numbers of processors.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item The ? wildcard character (meaning ``any single character'') is
    now supported on .PRINT lines for all analysis modes.
  \item The Xyce expression library now recognizes \texttt{TEMPER} and
    \texttt{HERTZ} as synonyms for \texttt{TEMP} and \texttt{FREQ},
    respectively.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Xyce/ADMS Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item A long-standing, obscure bug in ADMS's handling of ``for'' and
    ``while'' loops was fixed in Xyce/ADMS's version of ADMS implicit
    rules.  This bug was only tripped when the condition for these
    loops was in some way operating point dependent, an unusual usage
    heretofore unseen in standard Verilog-A models.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Important Announcements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item To enable improved performance, \Xyce{} now requires a C++11 capable
  compiler.
\item The model interpolation technique described in the \Xyce{}
  Reference Guide in section 2.1.18 has been marked as deprecated, and
  will be removed in a future release of Xyce.
\item It has been determined that some distributions of Linux have
  broken builds of OpenMPI in their package repositories.  Building
  \Xyce{} from source code in parallel with these OpenMPI installs
  will result in a version of \Xyce{} that may crash on some problems.
  This is not a bug in \Xyce{}, but a packaging error of the OpenMPI
  package on those operating systems.  Please see commentary in the
  ``Known Defects'' section of these release notes under bug number
  ``967-SON''.
 \item Support for the deprecated conversion of quoted-sting file 
  names to a table of data has been removed.  The supported method
  for reading a data file into a table is to use the \texttt{tablefile("")} keyword. 
  For example this would set the parameter, \texttt{PARAMETER} to a table 
  of data read from a file \texttt{"file.dat"}
  \texttt{PARAMETER=\{tablefile("file.dat")\}} 
  Using \texttt{PARAMETER="file.dat"} will set \texttt{PARAMETER} to the
  string value \texttt{"file.dat"}.  See the \Xyce{} Reference Guide
  under \texttt{GLOBAL\_PARAM} and Expressions for more details.  Device
  models that can take tables of data as parameters are documented
  under the appropriate device.
