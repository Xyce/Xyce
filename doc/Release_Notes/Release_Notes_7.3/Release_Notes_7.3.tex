\maketitle

The \XyceTM{} Parallel Electronic Simulator has been written to support the
simulation needs of Sandia National Laboratories' electrical designers.
\XyceTM{} is a SPICE-compatible simulator with the ability to solve extremely
large circuit problems on large-scale parallel computing platforms, but also
includes support for most popular parallel and serial computers.

\section{New Features and Enhancements}

\subsubsection*{New Devices and Device Model Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item The lossless transmission line history interpolation has been
    improved to better capture discontinuous signals such as those
    produced by pulsed voltage sources.  Various issues related to
    discontinuity detection and breakpointing were also fixed in this
    release.
  \item An ideal delay device has been added. Designated the YDELAY device, it
    operates in a manner similar to a voltage-controlled voltage source, in
    that The voltage between the positive and negative control nodes is
    reproduced at the positive and negative output nodes delayed by a specified
    time.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Enhanced Solver Stability, Performance and Features}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Increased parallel stability and robustness for simulation
    algorithms and models on increasing numbers of processors.
  \item Improved handling of dynamically inserted break points from
    devices that use history information, such as delay device. This
    resolved various accuracy issues, discontinuous behavior and
    convergence issues.
  \item \Xyce{} now supports non-intrusive Polynomial Chaos Expansion
    (PCE) methods as an augmentation to the \texttt{.SAMPLING} and
    \texttt{.EMBEDDEDSAMPLING} analyses.  This includes both the
    regression and projection forms of non-intrusive PCE. These PCE
    capabilities allow uncertainty to be accurately propagated thru a
    \Xyce{} calculation with a relatively small number of sample
    points.
  \item \Xyce{} now supports fully intrusive Polynomial Chaos
    Expansion (PCE) methods using the new \texttt{.PCE} command.  This
    is mostly an experimental method, and is an alternative to the
    non-intrusive forms of PCE that are also available in \Xyce{}.
  \item The \Xyce{} expression library now supports a fast piecewise
    linear table, \texttt{FASTTABLE}.  This feature is the same as
    \texttt{TABLE}, except that it only has time integration
    breakpoints at the first and last time point.  For very large
    tables this can result in a significant speedup.
  \item The \Xyce{} expression library now supports a variety of
    higher-order interpolators including \texttt{SPLINE},
    \texttt{AKIMA}, \texttt{WODICKA} and \texttt{CUBIC} splines.
    Another supported interpolator is \texttt{BLI} for Barycentric
    Lagrange Interpolation.  All of these interpolators use the same
    syntax as \texttt{TABLE} and \texttt{TABLEFILE}.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Interface Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item Support for \texttt{.FFT} and \texttt{.MEASURE FFT} has been
    added for \texttt{.TRAN} analyses.
  \item The ? wildcard character (meaning ``any single character'') is
    now supported on .PRINT lines for all analysis modes.
  \item The Xyce expression library now recognizes \texttt{TEMPER} and
    \texttt{HERTZ} as synonyms for \texttt{TEMP} and \texttt{FREQ},
    respectively.
  \item The Xyce expression library now recognizes the operators
    \texttt{nint()}, \texttt{fmod()} and \texttt{db()}.
  \item The default behavior of the random expression operators
    \texttt{GAUSS}, \texttt{AGAUSS}, \texttt{RAND}, \texttt{UNIF} and
    \texttt{AUNIF} has been changed so that they return the mean of
    the operator.  They now only return random values if one the
    various uncertainty quantification (UQ) analyses options
    (\texttt{.SAMPLING}, \texttt{.EMBEDDEDSAMPLING} or \texttt{.PCE})
    is specified in the netlist.
  \item Model binning is now turned on by default.  It is not
    necessary to specify the netlist command \texttt{.options parser}
    \texttt{model\_binning=true} anymore.
  \item Xyce's rawfile output when invoked with the ``-r'' option was
    unnecessarily changing the final ``\_'' in any variable name to a
    ``\#''.  It no longer does so.  This bug was never present in
    rawfiles produced via ``.print FORMAT=RAW'' lines, only the
    command-line version that causes all solution variables to be
    extracted into the rawfile.
  \item \texttt{.param} parameters are now allowed to depend on
    ``special'' variables such as \texttt{TEMP}, \texttt{TIME},
    \texttt{FREQ} and \texttt{VT}.  Previously, only
    \texttt{.global\_param} parameters could depend on special
    variables.
  \item \texttt{.param} parameters are now allowed to depend on
    \texttt{.global\_param} parameters.
  \item \texttt{.param} parameters in the top level scope can now be
    modified by commands such as \texttt{.STEP}, \texttt{.DC},
    \texttt{.SAMPLING}, \texttt{.EMBEDDEDSAMPLING}, \texttt{.PCE} and
    \texttt{LOCA}.  Previously, only \texttt{.global\_param}
    parameters could be modified by these commands.
  \item Expressions on the right-hand-side of \texttt{.param} 
    and \texttt{.global\_param} statements no longer need to be 
    surrounded by curly braces or single quotes.
  \item The search-path algorithm for files given on \texttt{.INC} and
    \texttt{.LIB} lines has been improved.  It should be more
    compatible with both commercial and open-source Process Design
    Kits (PDKs) now.
  \item Objective functions for \texttt{.AC} sensitivities can now be
    specified as expressions using the \texttt{acobjfunc} parameter.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{XDM}
\begin{XyceItemize}
    \item Fixed bug where relative path names to files in .lib statements were
        incorrect.
    \item XDM allows the undocumented PSpice syntax of having trailing
        commas in entries of ``TABLE'' statements.
    \item if/else/endif statements in HSPICE are now commented out
      since Xyce doesn't currently support this.
    \item Node names containing brackets, as seen in HSPICE, are
      now allowed.
    \item Forward slashes in HSPICE device and subckt names are now
      allowed.
    \item XDM now translates transient Spectre ``sine'' specifications.
    \item XDM comments out Spectre dc analysis statements with no parameters
        as it is not clear what the Xyce equivalent should be.
    \item XDM can now identify Spectre device instantiations of models
        defined in SPICE format.
    \item XDM removes Spectre ``trise'' parameter for R and C devices
        since this isn't available in \Xyce{}.
    \item Fixed bug in Spectre translation where sometimes the model name
        would not appear for a instantiation of a device of that model.
    \item Fixed XDM crash when processing some Spectre subcircuit
        definitions.
    \item Fixed bug in translation of Spectre ``include'' statements that have
        the parameter ``section''. These will now be translated into ``.LIB''
        statements in Xyce.
    \item Added support for translation of Spectre ``port'' device
        instantiations. Not all instance parameters are translated at this
        time.
    \item Translate the ``M'' unit prefix (mega) in Spectre ``AC'' statements
        to the \Xyce{} equivalent ``X''.
    \item XDM comments out Spectre dc analysis statements with no
        parameters as it is not clear what the \Xyce{} equivalent should be.
    \item Fixed bug where XDM aborted when translating Spectre ``include''
        files with paths containing hyphens.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Xyce/ADMS Improvements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
  \item A long-standing, obscure bug in ADMS's handling of ``for'' and
    ``while'' loops was fixed in Xyce/ADMS's version of ADMS implicit
    rules.  This bug was only tripped when the condition for these
    loops was in some way operating point dependent, an unusual usage
    heretofore unseen in standard Verilog-A models.
  \item The \texttt{buildxyceplugin} script will now define a
    Xyce-specific symbol ``\_\_XYCE\_\_`` when it runs ADMS to
    generate C++ code.  This symbol may be used in ifdefs in the
    Verilog-A source code to isolate Xyce-specific Verilog-A code.
\end{XyceItemize}

\subsubsection*{Important Announcements}
\begin{XyceItemize}
\item The CMake build system is now available in addition to the Autotools
     build system. See the \texttt{INSTALL.md} file for the CMake build
     instructions.
\item To enable improved performance, \Xyce{} now requires a C++11
  capable compiler.
\item The model interpolation technique described in the \Xyce{}
  Reference Guide in section 2.1.18 has been marked as deprecated, and
  will be removed in a future release of Xyce.
\item Some distributions of Linux have
  broken builds of OpenMPI in their package repositories.  Building
  \Xyce{} from source code in parallel with these OpenMPI installs
  will result in a version of \Xyce{} that may crash on some problems.
  This is not a bug in \Xyce{}, but a packaging error of the OpenMPI
  package on those operating systems.  Please see commentary in the
  ``Known Defects'' section of these release notes under bug number
  ``967-SON''.
 \item Support for the deprecated conversion of quoted-sting file
   names to a table of data has been removed.  The supported method
   for reading a data file into a table is to use the
   \texttt{tablefile("")} keyword.  Inside of expressions,
   \texttt{table("")} also works.  For example, to set the parameter
   \texttt{PARAMETER} to a table of data read from a file named
   \texttt{"file.dat"} one can use either
   \texttt{PARAMETER=\{tablefile("file.dat")\}} or
   \texttt{PARAMETER=\{table("file.dat")\}}.  Using
   \texttt{PARAMETER="file.dat"}, the old convention, will set
   \texttt{PARAMETER} to the string value \texttt{"file.dat"}.  See
   the \Xyce{} Reference Guide under \texttt{.GLOBAL\_PARAM},
   \texttt{.PARAM} and Expressions for more details.  Device models
   that can take tables of data as parameters are documented under the
   appropriate device.
