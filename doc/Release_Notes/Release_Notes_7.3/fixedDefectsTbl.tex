\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 150/Github issue 19}: Error Manager does not play well with repeatedly declared simulator API objects &
If a user code links to the Xyce libraries and allocates objects of
one of the Xyce simulator classes (either the base class
Xyce::Circuit::Simulator class or any of its derived classes) more
than once, the error manager's use of static data to keep count of
errors caused any failing simulation to cause all subsequent
simulations to fail.  Now, each simulator object clears the error
manager's error counts upon construction.

This fix does not eliminate problems related to the use of static data
in the error handling package.  Specifically, if multiple simulator
objects were run simultaneously in different threads then any fatal
error in any object's simulation would cause all to fail.  At this
time only sequential allocation and operation of simulator objects in
user code is supported. \\ \hline

\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 153/Github issue 21}: External Output Interface does not prepend TIME &
The documentation of the external output interface in an application
note claimed that if a user created an external output object that did
not include output of ``TIME'' for a transient run or ``FREQ'' for a
frequency-domain run, that the outputter would automatically prepend
that variable to the list of outputs actually delivered.  That was not
happening due to a simple coding error.  Now the interface performs
that operation as intended. \\ \hline

\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 143}: Fix transmission line breakpoint/discontinuity detection &
When the transmission line was modified in \Xyce{} 7.2 to stop forcing
a maximum timestep equal to the transmission line delay, bugs in the
handling of discontinuity detection and dynamically inserted
breakpoints were exposed.  As a result, transmission lines with very
short time delays could cause Xyce to detect a discontinuity at one
end of the line, but fail to set a breakpoint to catch the
discontinuity at the other end before the time integration had already
advanced too far.  The result of this combination of bugs could lead
to strange interpolation artifacts near the times when breakpoints
should have occurred.  The bugs in the time integration package's
timestep selection and in the nonlinear solver have been addressed,
and circuits involving transmission lines with very short delays will
no longer miss breakpoints in this manner. \\ \hline

\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 82}:  Make AC sensitivities work in parallel &
The initial implementation of AC parameter sensitivities did not work in 
  parallel, but this now works correctly.
\\ \hline

\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 115}:  Fix AC sensitivities to be correct for nonlinear 
  device model parameters & The original implementation of AC sensitivities had 
  a math mistake that caused the calculation to be incorrect when applied to 
  parameters from nonlinear devices.  The math error has been fixed and now
  nonlinear AC sensitivies work correctly.
\\ \hline

\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 123}:  POLY in the new expression library has problems 
  at higer orders ($>$2) & The new expression library had mistakes in the POLY 
  operator for higher-order polynomials, which have been corrected.  
\\ \hline

\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 99}:  Fix build flags associated with Trilinos &
Xyce is able to leverage some features of Trilinos in a beta mode. Some of
these were not enabled in the CMake build system, or were not functioning
correctly. This issue was focused on making those work properly. Specifically,
it was targeted at the inclusion of Amesos2, Stokhos, ShyLU, the Amesos2 Basker
(a templated linear solver), and the ShyLU Basker (a multi-threaded linear
solver). It also made Belos a required Trilinos package.
\\ \hline

\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 113}:  Make flex/bison a required capability &
Prior to the rewrite of the expression library, flex and bison were optional;
however, now they are required. The autotools and CMake build systems have now
been modified to reflect that. The ability to turn off the reaction parser
capability with a flag has been retained, however (with the default being
``on'').
\\ \hline

\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 128}: Fix Xyce/ADMS handling of some while and for loops &
Xyce/ADMS was emitting improper code for ``for'' or ``while'' loops
that contained what ADMS flagged as ``nonlinear'' conditions.  This
turned out to be due to an error in the implicit rules of ADMS that
has been present for at least 10 years, in which this unusual type of
condition resulted in an inappropriate double call to an early
dependency-tracking template.  The result was that contents of the
code block controlled by the loop construct was in backwards order,
and all function precomputation was happening twice (due to the
presence of duplicate entries in the ``function'' data structure).

Xyce/ADMS uses a modified version of ADMS's implicit rules file
instead of the one that ships with ADMS, and this error has now been
fixed in Xyce's modified version.

No standard Verilog-A models make use of ``for'' or ``while'' loops
that would have tripped this bug, but such a usage was found in a
Verilog-A model inside a proprietary vendor PDK. \\ \hline

\textbf{Gitlab-ex issue 103}: Fix glitches in transmission line at breakpoints &
The lossless transmission line is an ideal behavioral device that
operates by keeping a record of the histories of the two ends of the
line, and using interpolation on that history to look up prior
behavior at a time in the past in order to determine the current
behavior.  This interpolation is generally done using three-point
quadratic Lagrange interpolation.  It has been determined that Xyce
has historically been producing small ``glitches'' at the corners of
pulsed signals because quadratic interpolation is not really
appropriate with piecewise linear signals at the corners where the
slope changes signficantly.  Xyce now detects when such
discontinuities in derivative occur and performs linear interpolation
instead.  This prevents the small overshoots that have been observed
in these cases in all prior versions of Xyce. \\ \hline

\textbf{1203-SON}: Issues with temperature-dependent device
instance-parameters that were expression-based & The values for
temperature-dependent device instance parameters could be incorrect
if their expression used a global parameter. This could occur if the
default temperature of 27C was used.  It could also occur if the
temperature was set with a \texttt{.OPTIONS DEVICE} line or via
\texttt{.STEP}.  A simple example is:
\begin{verbatim}
.GLOBAL_PARAM GTEMP=37
R1 1 0 1  TC=0.1 temp={GTEMP}
\end{verbatim}
If the temperature was set with a \texttt{.OPTIONS DEVICE} line then
the use of a ``normal'' parameter in their expression could also give
an incorrect answer.  An example is:
\begin{verbatim}
.PARAM ptemp=10
R2 2 0 1  TC=0.1 temp={temp+ptemp}
\end{verbatim}
\\ \hline

\textbf{Gitlab-ex Issue 101, SON BUG 274}:  Remove deprecated parsing of quoted filename to table &
Double quoted strings were once parsed as filenames into a lookup table.  That syntax 
has been deprecated for some time and has now been removed. Use the \texttt{tablefile(``filename'')}
syntax to read a file into a table.  A double quoted string is 
now only interpreted as a string.  Additionally, the syntax \texttt{string(``'')} 
has also been removed as it was used to signify a string.
\\ \hline

\textbf{Gitlab-ex Issue 27}:  Clear out C++11 conditionals&
To enable improved performance, Xyce now requires a C++11 capable compiler.
Therefore, all the code conditionals related to C++11 features have been
removed from the code. 
\\ \hline
